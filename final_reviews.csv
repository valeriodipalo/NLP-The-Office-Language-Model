3,1,1,9.0,MaxBorg89,16 January 2009,"When it was first announced that NBC was going to adapt BBC hit The Office for American audiences, fans and critics feared the worst since, Showtime's Queer as Folk notwithstanding, US remakes of English shows have never been a smart move (example: Fox's fun but flimsy take on Doctor Who in 1996). Even some of the US version's cast-members (John Krasinski most famously) were uncertain regarding the program's critical and commercial success. As it turned out, those fears were unnecessary, for two good reasons: first of all, Simpsons and King of the Hill writer Greg Daniels took on the assignment of making The Office the next great American sitcom; and secondly, not only did Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais give the project their blessing, they also agreed to stay involved as executive producers and even co-wrote the pilot episode with Daniels.Just like in the original, everything is told as if it were part of a documentary, with an unspecified camera crew following the everyday events at the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of paper company Dunder-Mifflin. The regional manager is Michael Scott (Steve Carell), a child in a grown-up's body who sees himself as the ultimate boss and entertainer, while everyone else thinks he's a huge idiot. It is mainly Michael who delivers the show's trademark straight-to-camera remarks, although a few other people do pop up too occasionally. These include Michael's assistant Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), an ambitious, obnoxious career-devotee who insists on doing everything by the book, and his nemesis, sales manager Jim Halpert (Krasinski), who repeatedly teases Dwight with some help from the office's receptionist, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer).Plot-wise, three major things occur: Michael greets new employee Ryan Howard (B.J. Novak, who also serves as writer and executive producer), for whom he immediately develops a vaguely homo-erotic fondness, Dwight has to deal with Jim putting his stapler in Jell-O, and Jan Levinson Gould from Corporate reveals the branch might have to face downsizing. How does Michael react to the news? He promises nothing will happen and takes advantage of the situation to pull a few ""harmless"" pranks, with disastrous consequences.The plot, as any true fan must have noticed, is lifted verbatim from the BBC premiere episode, complete with ""Yankified"" jokes (Camilla Parker Bowles is replaced by Hillary Rodham Clinton). A lot of critics saw this as a blatant sign of weakness, calling the US version a mere knock-off of the far superior British prototype. In reality, Gervais and Merchant (who wrote both versions of the episode) did this on purpose, to see if the show's less broad sense of humor could translate well to American audiences. To everyone's delight, it translates perfectly, albeit with a few adjustments: the mood is a tad lighter than in the original (as proved by the more cheerful theme music), the characters are more likable (even Dwight, but that's all thanks to the superb Wilson), and the boss is a bit less of a pain in the ass. That last thing might also have to do with Carell's wise decision to avoid watching Gervais' celebrated performance for inspiration: he has his own style, and it has made him justifiably famous ever since (he was relatively unknown before the series went on the air).When it comes to American television, gambles usually pay off: a show about nothing? Best sitcom ever (Seinfeld). A real-time thriller? Compulsive small-screen viewing (24). A re-imagining of one of Britain's most cherished products? The funniest show of the 21st century's first decade, alongside the equally clever and hilarious 30 Rock.",37/42,first announce nbc adapt bbc hit office american audience fan critic fear bad since

10,1,1,7.0,smithpaulusmc,2 December 2019,"The Office's pilot episode introduces the shows main characters and biggest personalities in the context of impending downsizing. Office manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell), whose childish antics and inability to effectively lead his subordinates renders him nearly useless, learns that his branch is on the chopping block during the company's budget cuts. Rather than deal with the problem, Michael spends his time teasing his workers and holding pointless conferences.
Carell and The Office's ensemble which includes Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, and Jenna Fischer, is endearing and unique. Each character feels different from the next and despite their interpersonal conflicts, we wish the best for each of them.
From the outset, the show comedically introduces several plot points from which the story arc can grow. As previously mentioned, the impending downsizing threatens to end the Scranton branch. Will Michael and his cronies rise to the occasion or be miraculously saved from losing their jobs? Most intriguingly, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) appears to hold a friendly relationship with Pam Beasley (Jenna Fischer) that crosses into flirting. By the episode's end, we learn that Pam is currently dating a warehouse worker. This could open a story line of its own which could flesh out future episodes with more than one main plot.
The Office is a care-free, fresh take on the monotony of work life and the colorful characters that inhabit it. At this point in the series, there is not enough content to prove it will stand the test of time.

I still really enjoy watching this season, but it definitely gets better in Season 2.This show was meant to be an americanized version of the British show of the same name.

What Michael doesn't know is that the spokesperson in charge of the event, Mr. Brown (Larry Wilmore), is actually there because of numerous complaints about his behavior, not someone else's. That the boss thinks Mr . Brown is a made-up name - due to the person's skin color - isn't very helpful, either. Soon everyone in the office is involved in a series of increasingly ridiculous tolerance games that undermine everything Diversity Day is meant to stand for.From Michael's lame attempt at (mis)quoting Abraham Lincoln to Dwight's twisted mentality (when given a clue to find out what race he is representing as part of a test, he says: ""Aw man, what am I, a woman?""), this episode is a good example of the show's ability to pull off the same kind of awkward humor as the original version whilst adapting it to the American way of life.

31,1,2,8.0,JosephPezzuto,2 June 2015,"So says the ""World's Best Boss"" borrowing a quote from Abraham Lincoln. An adaptation of the BBC series of the same name created in 2001 by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, The Office was adapted for American audiences by Greg Daniels, veteran writer for SNL, King of the Hill and The Simpsons. Both sitcom and mockumentary, first airing on NBC on March 24, 2005 from May 16, 2013, the series depicts the everyday life of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. To simulate the look of an actual documentary, the show is filmed in a single-camera setup without a studio or a laugh track; our main characters sporadically posing as talking heads are either explaining or venting their emotions depending on however they happen to be feeling at that certain time to an unseen camera operator during a particular moment in the episode, often evoking hilarity. But when mixing in race? ""Diversity Day""! The second episode of the first season, the second episode overall, was written by Ken Kwapis (who also directed) and B. J. Novak who, for his work on this episode, was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy. When the egotistical but shallow central character Michael Scott (Steve Carell, loosely based on David Brent from the original British version) makes a controversial imitation of a Chris Rock routine, he forces the staff to undergo a racial seminar. A sensitivity trainer arrives (guest starring Office consulting producer and writer Larry Wilmore as Mr. Brown) to give the staff in the office a practical presentation about tolerance and diversity. Michael, however insists on imparting his own knowledge, aggravating both the consultant and the entire office staff in creating his own diversity seminar instead. Michael is seen later on signing the release for Mr. Brown passed around, with the name ""Daffy Duck"". Mr. Brown does not realize that the signature is bogus. Michael quickly fashions his more ambitious and improvisational program under the name ""Diversity Tomorrow"" (because today is almost over""). First asking the employees to detail their particular nationalities, he helpfully offers that he is a ""virtual United Nations"" of English, Scottish, Irish, German and ""2/15 Native American"" origins, thus assigning each office member an index card with a different race written on it. They are to guess what race they are based on by the actions and phrases recited to them by their co-workers but are not allowed to read it, wearing and displaying it on their foreheads for only others to see. Compelling the employees to interact and ""mix up the melting pot"" causes tempers to slowly simmer. Many uncomfortable but hilarious exchanges of various stereotypes occur between them, as Michael reasons that they will learn how it is to ""be a minority"" while ironically bringing up offensive stereotypes himself (Scott has no card for ""Arab"" or ""Muslim"", because, he explains, it would be ""too explosive""). This continues on until the staff finally snap under toleration for such petty inaneness. Meanwhile, Dunder Mifflin representative and love interest of the shy Pam Beesley (Jenna Fischer) Jim ""Big Tuna"" or just ""Tuna"" Harper (John Krasinski) struggles to keep hold of a lucrative contract extension that makes up about twenty-five percent of his annual commission. Amidst the entropy of the day, Dwight Kurt Schrute III (Rainn Wilson, based on Gareth Keenan from the original UK version), the successful paper salesman lacking in social skills, common sense and of whom is pretty much a fascist nerd, closes the sale for himself. Despite his initial personal dislike of Jim, the two are a very effective sales team nonetheless. Jim gets one of life's little victories when Pam falls asleep on his shoulder at the end of a meeting, as he concludes that is was ""not a bad day"". Premiering on NBC on April 5, 2005, it lost half of its viewing audience due to the previous episode, being the pilot, which had garnered over eleven million viewers to this episode's six. On the flipside, ""Diversity Day"", along with the other first season episodes of The Office helped NBC score its highest-rated Tuesday night slot since February 1, 2005. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode positive reviews, stating that: ""Think of the toss-off racism of the original, plopped into a PC-gone-wrong showcase that might be entitled The Accidental Bigot. As when the African-American diversity trainer introduces himself as Mr. Brown, and Scott assures him, 'I will not call you that.'"" Ricky Gervais stated: ""It is as good. I love the fact that, apart from the first one, the scripts are all original. You've gone back to the blueprint of what the characters are and you've started from there, as opposed to copying anything."" Rolling Stone magazine named the scene wherein Michael shows the office his diversity video the third greatest moment from The Office. However, Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a ""B+"", noting that the episode ""would go on to be one of the series' defining episodes, an installment that put a more hopeful spin on the original Office‍'s views on accepting the disparity between our dreams and our realities."" Two scenes that were cut involved Michael Scott responding to Mr. Brown's ""HERO"" acronym by creating one that sounded good until everyone noticed the words created the acronym of ""INCEST"", while another had Jim replacing Dwight's ""Asian"" headband with ""Dwight"" and then having the other co-workers complain to his clueless character about how annoying his behavior was. The pilot after the pilot, ""Diversity Day"" defined NBC'S The Office for cast and crew alike. Kwapis reflects: ""Well, it certainly took a while to find its audience. But creatively the show hit a home run in episode two. I mean, that episode really is a standout. Two hundred episodes later, that's really a standout.""",6/10,say world good boss borrow quote abraham_lincoln adaptation bbc series name create 0000 ricky_gervais stephen_merchant office adapt

39,1,3,9.0,MaxBorg89,11 February 2009,"In the British version of The Office, there was a particularly hilarious moment when a doctored pornographic image of the boss was discovered and the concerned individual asked his assistant to find out who was behind it. Since the US remake of the show never intended to be a mere copycat, a roughly similar plot line (the assistant doing the job) is used in a completely different context.The context - a very important one in the workplace - is health care, an issue that gives this episode its title. Michael's problem is he's been asked by Jan to find a health care plan that's effective but also not too expensive. Thinking such a task is too much for him, he passes it on to Dwight, who is always eager to please the boss. Naturally, given Dwight's strict adherence to work ethics and lack of sense of humor, Jim and Pam make it their mission to turn his day into a living Hell, whereas Michael must come up with a way to cheer up his employees in case anything goes wrong.What makes this a great episode is the fact that it depicts the first open ""conflict"" between Jim and Dwight (with the former being helped by Pam, of course), following their minor dispute over the incorrect use of a stapler in the pilot (a scene that occurred in the UK blueprint as well). Even funnier, though, is the way they react to the presence of the camera: there's no greater joy than that which comes from watching Rainn Wilson as he compares himself to a hunter in the jungle or hearing John Krasinski deliver the priceless line: ""If this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train."".

Of course, Dwight reveals his trust issues to the camera crew, and boy, are they justified: the moment the ""alliance"" kicks off, Jim starts planning various schemes at his co-worker's expense. Meanwhile, Michael keeps coming up with ways to distract his staff from the gossip-induced paranoia.Like the previous episode, The Alliance is 20 minutes of comedy gold, based primarily on the spot-on interactions between John Krasinski and the superb Rainn Wilson, who almost do an even better job than Martin Freeman and McKenzie Crook in the British prototype.

Meanwhile, Dwight deals with the downsizing by suggesting an ""alliance"" with Jim.Much of the episode is kind of dull, there's little to laugh at besides Dwight's water bottle. Michael makes a reference to Donald Trump, but it's hard to see why I should care and if anyone else will in twenty years. He also makes a Star Trek reference that isn't very funny. Nevertheless, I can appreciate how imperfect a month-early birthday party is, and Pam's question as to what the ""alliance"" really means is a valid one.Towards the end, the episode does provide some laughs. The birthday girl's reaction, including to a cake she can't eat for medical reasons, is good. The downsizing joke is awkward. The fact that it's the temp's actual birthday is a humorous twist.

As office politics play a part, the staff try to deal with this hanging over their heads as well as the usual ongoing petty nonsense that is part of any office life.Adapting what is really a very British sitcom to be suitable for American tastes was never going to be easy and the first season of this show (which has grown in popularity) shows the problems right away. Season 1 is, for the most part, a straight reproduction of the original in terms of some of the stories but also very much the painful awkward feel of the whole thing. What this achieves is a quite funny sitcom because the material is pretty good but it falls down quite badly when it comes to the more painful part of the material  which in the UK original was essentially the show. We all remember the original as hilarious but the truth is that much of it was funny while being unbearably awkward. This worked so well because the characters so totally sold it as real and you felt them dying inside as well as seeing them act awkward at that moment.Here we have the conflicting aims of comedy and pain and the two don't sit well together. I got the sense that the US makers felt they wanted to do the UK version but that at the same time had a different vision for the show based on the US audience and also the different structure of the show (after all, the UK one was about 12 episodes total  not quite what the US networks expect from their shows). Perhaps it is better if you have never seen the original but the conflict can be seen in many areas but most noticeably in two key characters - Brent/Scott and Jim/Tim. Scott is very much a comedian who tries too hard and frequently falls flat, looking trapped by his own attempts at being ""cool. Brent was similar but his character was much more convincing and real  a tiny man who one feels terrible pity for. Likewise Tim's pain and sense of being overwhelmed by the pointlessness of it all was palatable whereas Jim is far too perky and seems to be wearing it reasonably well.Again this may be part of the longer game-plan as the development of characters over longer US seasons would be difficult if they arrived fully formed but it does the actors a bit of a disservice in this first season. Don't get me wrong though, the first season is still funny  even when it comes over as a bit of a lesser copy, it does still generate laughs and awkwardness. However it is best when it is creating new material totally and worrying less about getting everything the same as the UK original. This is encouraging because, with 4 or 5 seasons now made, it is clear that it must have become its own master now given how little source material there is. Here though it must be said that it is impossible to avoid the US/UK comparison because it is writ large across almost all of the six episodes and, in attempting the same thing, the US version does fall short of the mark  this is not protectionist sentiment, just the way it is.The cast struggle by comparison because of the similarity. I think everyone is good enough to be able to raise their game when the show settles in but in this first season it is hard to avoid the sense of the cast not ""getting it"" in the way the original did. Again, I add the caveat of the longer game plan and the ""pilot"" nature of the first season but I cannot help say that Carell (who I like) is just not as good as Gervias at the pained stuff. He is at his best as the foolish clown but he cannot nail the inner emptiness and pathos that is what we all remember Brent for. Sadly the material makes this weakness more apparent. Wilson is a solid turn but again doesn't compare with the original. Krasinski offers more of a US sitcom role and I think will be good at this but again he struggles with trying to fit into the reproduced material while also having a less developed character. The only person of the whole cast who really nails the pained thing is Fischer as I totally believed the small deaths she suffered with every day in the office  she is excellent here.Season 1 is generally funny and, if I had not seen the original then I would probably have liked it more. However it stays too close to the original, suffering by comparison and also never finding its own voice or direction. I think the potential is there though and will follow this with season 2 to see where it goes and what it does when it has to start to find its own way.",3/15,small branch stationary company

62,1,6,9.0,zkonedog,5 July 2019,"For the past few years, I considered the TV series ""Family Guy"" to be the funniest show on the tube for its ability to poke fun at anything and everything. Yet, more than likely due to the rather sick mind of creator Seth McFarlane, that show tends to beat you over the head (sometimes again and again and again) with its jokes in rather crude fashion. It can be hilarious, don't get me wrong, but a show like that can only stay fresh for so long without having to up the ""shock ante"" with every episode.Just recently, though, I discovered ""The Office"" while utilizing a free trial of Netflix and was blown away by the subtleness of the humor that abounds in each and every episode. I had watched bits and pieces of certain episodes in the past, but beginning to watch them in broadcast order really helped me put the pieces together and enjoy every second of each 20-minute episode.Basically, the show is set at the Dunder-Mifflin paper company in Scranton, PA, where a very diverse group of office workers work the 9-5 cubicle life under the ""direction"" of Michael Scott (played by Steve Carell). It's very much like a toned-down, more realistically-funny version of the feature film ""Office Space"". But here's the catch: Michael is, by and large, a complete idiot, and thus the office functions accordingly.In this first season (only six episodes long, likely due to its ""trial run"" status in the U.S. to see if it could duplicate the success of its United Kingdom namesake show), all the building blocks of the show are put in place in terms of character development, relationships, and humor. Really, there are three reasons why the show (right from this very first season) resonated so much with American audiences:First, is the notion that all the characters are so relatable to potential real-life situations. Everyone can relate to the idiot boss (Michael), the office suck-up (Dwight), the ""normal"" or ""cool"" ones (Jim and Pam), the pervert (Kevin) and the tightly-wound frosty woman (Angela), to name just a few. While those characters are of course amped up a bit from what a real office feels like, there still exists that sense that you yourself could just as easily be in the same situation they are.Another reason this show is so successful is the focus on the characters of Jim and Pam. Both are acted extraordinarily by John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer and are truly the heart and soul of the show. Audiences can easily relate to the romantic tension and silly pranks between the two because of what could be called a ""normalcy complex"": they are the two most normal, fun characters on the show, and thus the audience roots for them due to the fact that they represent what we want to be at work. Your heart will break as they both struggle to figure out a relationship that seems destined to be, but at the same time you will also laugh along with them as they pull their silly pranks on various office personnel.Finally, though, what truly sets this show apart from any other comedy series I have previously seen is the fact that storylines are progressed from episode to episode. Unlike some half-hour comedies (like Family Guy) where, by and large, the slate is pretty much wiped clean after every episode, ""The Office"" instead builds on certain plot and character threads to create continuity. Thus, the characters actually grow and learn on screen in front of you, so to speak, and don't just stagnate repeating the same old jokes or gags.Thus, I would pretty much recommend this show to anybody who has ever held a job (not too limiting, huh?!), as you will be able to instantly relate to the kind of antics that transpire.",7/10,past year consider series family guy funniest show tube

64,1,6,8.0,MaxBorg89,31 October 2009,"Most people argue that the first season of the Americanized Office was too similar to the British original (and it certainly applies to the pilot episode, which was co-written by Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant and US developer Greg Daniels), most notably in the number of episodes in the first season: just six, like a standard UK sitcom. However, the reduced episode order was probably due to simple caution on the part of NBC, who wanted to check if American audiences would respond to the series before requesting a standard-length season.Funny coincidences aside, Hot Girl is a very amusing season finale, in which most of the male staff go ""crazy"" when an attractive saleswoman (Amy Adams) shows up in the Dunder Mifflin building. Michael and Dwight make fools of themselves immediately, Roy makes an inappropriate comment in Pam's presence and Jim... well, he doesn't have any problems, really.While not exactly setting up a second season, Hot Girl works admirably as a finale, reminding us why The Office is such a terrific show with some priceless displays of awkward comedy (anything Dwight says) and pure laughs (Ryan washing Michael's car: genius).

Why not make two separate episodes, one about the firing and one about the Halloween party? Both would make valid stories. Maybe the two ideas were combined because unemployment is scary, scarier than any vampire or gremlin. Or maybe it was just supposed to be funny because Michael chose a completely inappropriate day to let someone go. Halloween is supposed to be fun.

121,2,8,8.0,gizmomogwai,3 March 2009,"This is one of my favourite episodes from The Office's second season. In it, the bosses at the office are reviewing their employees' performances, while Michael is obsessed with his relationship with his boss Jan. The two had kissed, but Jan is not interested in continuing with this type of relationship with Michael and wants to stay professional. Meanwhile, Michael for the first time checks the suggestion box at the office looking for ideas.This episode is funny partly because of its insensitivity, towards race (Michael asks a black employee if he learned something on the street), and towards the depressed (""That guy was weird."") The suggestion box scene is a highlight of the episode. Some of the humour comes from Jan, who's frustrated with Michael's obsession with their relationship, and she sees Michael handling the performance review for Dwight in an unsatisfactory way. This leads to the episode's priceless moment, where Dwight, Michael and Jan talk about what constitutes a ""serious offense,"" again to Jan's frustration. Eventually this leads to Jan rejecting Michael while describing his personality in a nutshell, in another great scene from this episode.As for the subplot, in which Jim and Pam trick Dwight into thinking a Thursday is a Friday, it's not particularly funny until the end when it ties in with the plot about the performance reviews and Dwight wanting a raise.

213,2,22,,bob the moo,12 April 2009,"When it first came out I gave The Office US a pass and didn't think much of it as all I could do was compare and contrast with the UK version. A month or so back I decided to take another look because I figured that, after five seasons, it must be doing something right. Starting again with season 1 I found again that it was a poor copy, trying to replicate the UK version but failing to do so, partly because it didn't really want to do so but felt it should. Season two does not repeat that mistake and, by the halfway point I no longer felt that it deserved to be compared to the original so much as just be judged on its own merits.Although the awkwardness of the first season is still part of the comedy, it is no longer the ""painful"" embarrassment that it tried to copy from the original but rather it plays like a more confident US sitcom. The device of the film crew remains constant but the material is a lot more comical than season 1 and seems a better fit in terms of the characters and aims of the series. To a point the season could be put down as a series of 20-minutes sketches because each more or less does serve as a standalone episode with a central idea at the core but the show does well to integrate threads across the season. The most obvious of these is Jim and Pam's flirty friendship thing and this works better here than it did in the UK version, partly because the writers perfectly capture this type of relationship but also because the tone of the show allows it to happen by being warm rather than bitter in its comedy. This is not a criticism of the UK version but it is simply true that in the US, this works better because the American psyche is a bit more positive and ""big"" whereas in the UK the comedy of embarrassment and awkwardness just sits better with who we are! As a result of doing what it wants to do rather than what it feels it should do, the show gains confidence and is very consistent in what it does. It has its high points that are hilarious but mostly it is just consistently pretty funny and each episode threw me plenty of chuckles and a couple of good big laughs. This is helped by the show utilising the supporting characters to do more than awkwardly look away in silence when Michael does something shocking (although they still do that). Instead each person gets fleshed out a bit and given a lot more material, which is fair enough and also allows for the office to feel fuller and less reliant on one or two characters to deliver laughs and plot. Of course the main characters remain that way and the cast do well with this. Carell seems a lot more comfortable with his character rather than he did in season 1 because it suits his style better. As a result he is funnier and a lot more likable even if he is still very much a jerk with no self-awareness. Krasinski doesn't grip me as an actor but he does make for a very real person and I like him for that. He works well with Fischer, who does her stuff very well, whether it is being shocked silence or being overly close to Jim – the two of them together make the office relationship aspect work. Wilson is better as well as he has better material including some awesome lines (the one about smiling and monkeys is a killer and a good example).The example of using the other characters more is best seen in Kaling' Kelly, who has gone from being ""the Indian women to allow Michael to be racist"" to being a ditzy valley girl type who is a very funny character and a dream-world of romance in her head. I like her a great deal and she makes for plenty of good asides during each episodes. Novak benefits from this and he does well with a Jim-esquire character of being trapped. Baker, Baumgartner, Kinsey, Bratton and many others all step up and the show benefits by having much more of an ensemble feel that adds to the impression of a show growing comfortable with itself.Season 2 is not an awesome affair and I wasn't wiping tears from my eyes but it is still very consistent and pretty funny, while delivering good big laughs here and there each episode. From season 1 the show now feels like its own creature and is doing what it wants to do rather than just copying The Office UK in a way that doesn't work. The result is more enjoyable and entertaining and I look forward to season 3 for more of the same.",27/34,first come give office pass think much could compare contrast version month back decide take

216,2,22,10.0,zkonedog,5 July 2019,"The first ""season"" (six episodes) of The Office was little more than a sort of ""trial run"" to see whether or not the British sensation would catch on with an American audience. Once it proved that it could be hilarious, however, this second season cemented the show as one of the funniest (and most touching) comedies of all time.The biggest, most interesting, and most dramatic theme of the second season is the relationship between Pam Beasley (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). On one hand, you will laugh along with them as they make fun of boss Michael Scott (Steve Carell), play pranks on office suck-up Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and make the boring Scranton branch of the Dunder-Mifflin paper supply company as fun as possible in their own little discreet way. Besides the comedy, though, you will also be touched by the genuineness of their casual flirtings/friendship despite the fact that anything more just doesn't seem destined to be. For a comedy, the writers do a remarkable job of making you care about both Jim and Pam, as (at least in this season of the show) they really are the backbone of the whole experience.Lest we forget the comedic genius of Carell as Michael Scott, though, this season also sees his character grow in new and always hilarious ways. His ""relationship"" with boss Jan provides plenty of opportunities for hilarity, as do company work days devoted to such topics as diversity and sexual harassment. Michael always seems to come through with the best possible line in the worst possible situation, and that is what makes him so hilarious.Finally, again building off of the success of the first six episodes, I continued to be impressed by the ability of the writers/creators to keep the plots and relationships moving forward from episode to episode. While many half-hour comedies stagnate and let their protagonists fall into the same routine and same old jokes every week, The Office advances the formula in order to keep things fresh.Thus, if you in any way, shape, or form enjoyed the first season of ""The Office"", this second installment will not disappoint you whatsoever, as it continues to both tickle the funny bone and pull at the heartstrings...often at the same time!",22/24,first season six episode office little sort trial run see whether british sensation would catch american audience prove could hilarious however second season cement show one funniest touching comedy time big interesting dramatic theme second season relationship pam beasley jenna_fischer jim halpert john_krasinski one hand laugh along make fun boss michael_scott steve_carell play prank office suck dwight schrute rainn_wilson make boring scranton_branch dunder_mifflin paper supply company fun possible little discreet way besides comedy though also touch genuineness casual flirting friendship despite fact anything seem destine comedy writer remarkable job make care jim_pam least season show really backbone whole experience lest forget comedic genius carell michael_scott though season also see character grow new always hilarious way relationship boss jan provide plenty opportunity hilarity company work day devote topic diversity sexual_harassment michael always seem come good possible line bad possible situation make hilarious finally build success first six episode continue impress ability writer creator keep plot relationship move forward episode episode many half hour comedy stagnate let protagonist fall routine old joke every week office advance formula order keep thing fresh thus way shape form enjoy first season office second installment disappoint whatsoever continue tickle funny bone pull heartstring often time,"['first', 'season', 'six', 'episode', 'office', 'little', 'sort', 'trial', 'run', 'see', 'whether', 'british', 'sensation', 'would', 'catch', 'american', 'audience', 'prove', 'could', 'hilarious', 'however', 'second', 'season', 'cement', 'show', 'one', 'funniest', 'touching', 'comedy', 'time', 'big', 'interesting', 'dramatic', 'theme', 'second', 'season', 'relationship', 'pam', 'beasley', 'jenna_fischer', 'jim', 'halpert', 'john_krasinski', 'one', 'hand', 'laugh', 'along', 'make', 'fun', 'boss', 'michael_scott', 'steve_carell', 'play', 'prank', 'office', 'suck', 'dwight', 'schrute', 'rainn_wilson', 'make', 'boring', 'scranton_branch', 'dunder_mifflin', 'paper', 'supply', 'company', 'fun', 'possible', 'little', 'discreet', 'way', 'besides', 'comedy', 'though', 'also', 'touch', 'genuineness', 'casual', 'flirting', 'friendship', 'despite', 'fact', 'anything', 'seem', 'destine', 'comedy', 'writer', 'remarkable', 'job', 'make', 'care', 'jim_pam', 'least', 'season', 'show', 'really', 'backbone', 'whole', 'experience', 'lest', 'forget', 'comedic', 'genius', 'carell', 'michael_scott', 'though', 'season', 'also', 'see', 'character', 'grow', 'new', 'always', 'hilarious', 'way', 'relationship', 'boss', 'jan', 'provide', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'hilarity', 'company', 'work', 'day', 'devote', 'topic', 'diversity', 'sexual_harassment', 'michael', 'always', 'seem', 'come', 'good', 'possible', 'line', 'bad', 'possible', 'situation', 'make', 'hilarious', 'finally', 'build', 'success', 'first', 'six', 'episode', 'continue', 'impress', 'ability', 'writer', 'creator', 'keep', 'plot', 'relationship', 'move', 'forward', 'episode', 'episode', 'many', 'half', 'hour', 'comedy', 'stagnate', 'let', 'protagonist', 'fall', 'routine', 'old', 'joke', 'every', 'week', 'office', 'advance', 'formula', 'order', 'keep', 'thing', 'fresh', 'thus', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'enjoy', 'first', 'season', 'office', 'second', 'installment', 'disappoint', 'whatsoever', 'continue', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone', 'pull', 'heartstring', 'often', 'time']"

While this was arguably the weakest part of the episode, there was still a lot to like, especially the twist ending.What truly elevates this episode is what happens with Jim and Pam.

The writing, the acting, even the camerawork, was just perfect, creating one of the most realistic love confession scenes ever to be on TV.

The moment when Michael kisses Oscar is shocking, but it feels deserved, as the ultimate climax to a fantastic episode. The fact that Michael surprised the cast by doing this only adds to the scene. Aside from the main plot, everything else is great. Stanley has a hilarious moment, as he laments about having two toasters in his house as Pam and Roy recount the events leading up to and following their breakup.

246,3,1,8.0,frenchmoodle,26 September 2006,"Personally, I think the strongest episodes of ""The Office"" came from the first half of season 2. Not that the second half of season 2 was bad... but jokes about ""presents"" left on carpets and entire episodes revolving around Dwight Shrute's volunteer sheriff duties did not entirely reach the bar set earlier that season with hilarious episodes such as ""The Dundies,"" ""The Client,"" and ""Christmas Party."" With the show's Emmy win in August, of course there's going to be more pressure to do well. The season premiere was pretty hilarious, but also had a dark tone, similar to that of its BBC predecessor. When Oscar's sexuality is accidentally outed by oblivious boss Michael Scott, chaos ensues the Scranton office. The first half of the episode spends probably too much time tying up loose ends from last season (for example: why Ryan is no longer a temp, what happened between Jim and Pam, why Phyllis has a rock on her finger, and why Roy is in the warehouse tearing up...) Oscar is met with immature giggling from his co-workers, paranoia that his homosexuality is contagious, and ignorant statements from Michael. Angela's behavior toward him, along with his breakdown and confrontation to Michael (followed by Michael's own breakdown) gives the episode a mix of shock, sadness and pure insanity. Jim's new job results in him relying on the documentary crew for the comfort and fun he once had in Scranton, and questions unfold, bound to create a new story arch for the beginning of this new season.Overall, Gay Witch Hunt had me laughing and out of my seat, but it may take a few views to fully appreciate.",16/23,personally think strong episode office come first half season second half season bad joke present leave carpet entire episode revolve around dwight shrute volunteer_sheriff duty entirely reach bar set early season hilarious episode dundies client christmas party show emmy win august course pressure well season premiere pretty hilarious also dark tone similar bbc predecessor oscar sexuality accidentally oblivious boss michael_scott chaos ensue scranton office first half episode spend probably much time tie loose end last season example ryan long temp happen jim_pam phyllis rock finger roy warehouse tear oscar meet immature giggle worker paranoia homosexuality contagious ignorant statement michael angela behavior toward along breakdown confrontation michael follow michael breakdown give episode mix shock sadness pure insanity jim new job result rely documentary crew comfort fun scranton question unfold bind create new story arch beginning new season overall gay witch_hunt laugh seat may take view fully appreciate,"['personally', 'think', 'strong', 'episode', 'office', 'come', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'bad', 'joke', 'present', 'leave', 'carpet', 'entire', 'episode', 'revolve', 'around', 'dwight', 'shrute', 'volunteer_sheriff', 'duty', 'entirely', 'reach', 'bar', 'set', 'early', 'season', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'dundies', 'client', 'christmas', 'party', 'show', 'emmy', 'win', 'august', 'course', 'pressure', 'well', 'season', 'premiere', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'also', 'dark', 'tone', 'similar', 'bbc', 'predecessor', 'oscar', 'sexuality', 'accidentally', 'oblivious', 'boss', 'michael_scott', 'chaos', 'ensue', 'scranton', 'office', 'first', 'half', 'episode', 'spend', 'probably', 'much', 'time', 'tie', 'loose', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'example', 'ryan', 'long', 'temp', 'happen', 'jim_pam', 'phyllis', 'rock', 'finger', 'roy', 'warehouse', 'tear', 'oscar', 'meet', 'immature', 'giggle', 'worker', 'paranoia', 'homosexuality', 'contagious', 'ignorant', 'statement', 'michael', 'angela', 'behavior', 'toward', 'along', 'breakdown', 'confrontation', 'michael', 'follow', 'michael', 'breakdown', 'give', 'episode', 'mix', 'shock', 'sadness', 'pure', 'insanity', 'jim', 'new', 'job', 'result', 'rely', 'documentary', 'crew', 'comfort', 'fun', 'scranton', 'question', 'unfold', 'bind', 'create', 'new', 'story', 'arch', 'beginning', 'new', 'season', 'overall', 'gay', 'witch_hunt', 'laugh', 'seat', 'may', 'take', 'view', 'fully', 'appreciate']"

Michael's crazy with Pretzel Day. Dwight is crazy in his own way taking Ryan out on a ""sales call"". One of my favorite humor lines of all time in the show is ""as you planted your seed in the ground now I will plant my seed in you"". Even Stanley comes to life. You've got to watch the deleted scene with him and Michael. Best TWSS of all time.This was one of the first episodes I liked the Stamford story too. The squeaky chair and Jim singing The Cardigans ""Lovefool"". Poor Karen begging him to stop because it's ""not a proportional response"" and Andy finishing the lyrics off in his classic falsetto.And all of this before what is one of the best JAM moments in the show's run. No it's not the wedding or him asking her out on their first date. At least their first date according to Pam - Jim will always say their first date was grilled cheese on the roof in The Client <3 Those have to be top 2.He was only trying to get Kevin's voice-mail and he got her instead. It's a perfect early JAM moment because they talk so easily just like they always did. And then it ends too soon.

The only issue I have with this episode is the underhanded and backstabbing way in which Andy maligns Dwight to Michael throughout the entire show. I don't enjoy Ed Helms as an actor and when he was in a few episodes in Stamford I hoped I could ignore him until his character was written out. Unfortunately, he has been added to the core group now and I find him to be a distasteful and unwanted addition. He really does ruin every scene he's in. Though I've watched the entire series from beginning to end several times, this episode always serves as a reminder why I strongly dislike the Andy character and Ed Helms in general.

1. Jim moves to Stamford but then moves back after it closes down, prompting a merger with Dunder Mifflin that places new characters, Karen Filippelli and Andy Bernard, among the office regulars. Jim starts a relationship with Karen but still has feelings for Pam.
2. Dwight's his usual oddball self, secretly in a relationship with Angela, and still Dundee Mifflin's top salesman. With Andy's entrance into Dunder Mifflin, his ways of sucking up to Michael make him a bigger threat to Dwight than Jim, and they become mortal enemies
3. And Pam, heartbroken as she is, managed to maintain her perky personality in the workplace
4. And of course, Michael Scott himself, struggling to find happiness while striving to remain the world's greatest boss at Dunder Mifflin.I'll leave it at those four for now, as I've gotta get to the reviewIn this episode ""The Return,"" Dwight has left Dunder Mifflin (more on that in the previous episode) and is now working at a Staples store, while the rest of the office now has to put up with Andy's annoying antics. Through various changes in the mood and organization of the workplace (surplus of clients, wilted plants, disorganized desk toys), everyone suddenly realizes how much Dwight meant to Dunder Mifflin. It's also bad timing, as Oscar has just returned to the office after a ""gay-cation"" that lasted half the season. Andy, reveling in Dwight's absence, continues trying to suck up to Michael and manages to annoy everyone around him, and creeping out Michael himself. He also may or may not realize how much this reflects his own antics in previous seasons (""I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness""). In the end, Michael realizes his mistake, and brings Dwight back to a grateful Dunder Mifflin. As for Andy, he gets his comeuppance after a prank by Jim and Pam (back at it again (yes!)) which then leads to a rejection by Michael that leaves us thankful and then in stitches, as this is followed by a crazed wall punch by Andy Bernard himself (exposed!). There's only one thing to say for all of this: Dwight Schrute FOREVER!In this episode, almost all of the characters' narrative story arcs for season 3 reach a climax, and what a climax it is.
1. Jim is back to his prank-pulling self, and really still has feelings for Pam, once again his accomplice in his pranks when no one else will be (no surprise by Ryan, but a real blunder on Karen's part)
2. Pam remains perky and helpful as ever, even attempting to console Angela in a heartfelt exchange where she sort of admits her feelings for Dwight, bringing us to:
3. Angela shows her sentimental side
4. Dwight remains his Dwight Schrute self, even bringing his dedicated ways into his new workplace, where it's not accepted unfortunately for him. Still, as always, Dwight perseveres, and gives us a perfect description of himself in the process (""How would I describe myself? Three words: Hardworking, alpha-male, jackhammer... merciless... insatiable..."").
5. And last but not least, Michael Scott himself. While his relationship with Dwight was certainly not his cup of tea, Michael realizes what Dwight means to the company, his surroundings, and him, even preferring him over Andy. When he brings Dwight back, not only does he admit he made a mistake and fixes it (""It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man""), but he also takes a big step in the right direction for his fellow peers and all who view him as Michael Scott: The World's Greatest Boss.For bringing us stunning narrative turning points for the characters as well as tons of hilarious memorable moments, I call ""The Return"" one of the show's shining achievements and up there among the all-time best episodes of The Office.

366,3,22,10.0,rahenson1,15 November 2010,"The review for this episode was by someone who at the least doesn't like Pam. I won't claim to be objective either. But you're going to get a review from someone who loves that character rather than hates her.Pam has tried hard all through season three to grow. We find out at the beginning of the season that she didn't marry Roy and has moved out on her own. When Jim comes back she's excited, but then disappointed when she finds out he's with Karen. She finally starts taking art classes. She hosts a show and no one except for Michael talks to her there. Oscar and Gil make fun of her art. Jim doesn't come. She's not perfect. She gets back together with Roy when depressed at Phyllis' wedding.She literally walks across fire in this episode. And that's not the hardest thing (for her) that she does. She finally tells Jim he was right about them. Is it too late? I'm sure you already know the answer that it wasn't.

368,3,23,,bob the moo,1 May 2009,"I read a comment in the paper a few days ago that disputed someone's claim that 30 Rock was the best sitcom out there at the moment because the writer of this piece of blurb felt it was the US version of The Office. I didn't think too much about it because it is all opinion but I can see the point. In my opinion 30 Rock is by far the better comedy because it gets the biggest laughs out of me, but The Office is the better sitcom. The reason for this disparity is because The Office has a better narrative running through the jokes and has characters that the viewer cares about beyond their role as comedy material. This was seen in season 2 of The Office (the first good season) but the way they ended that season perhaps made me think that things would be awkward or difficult to carry on from – particularly in a show which I already know is on its 5th season.I needn't have worried though because S3 does a very good job of moving on from the conclusion of the previous season and keeping the character threads going. We join quite some time after the end of the last season, with characters scattered a bit, new characters added, new unspoken complications but yet also the continuation of the same awkward relationships that I enjoyed from season 2. This continues till about the mid-point of the season where the dynamics are changed again, while also still keeping the same essential plots. It is to the writers' credit that it works as well as it does because the character-driven plots are evenly spread across the season and each episode; OK they have moments where they come to the fore but they never feel like they are sitting on a shelf waiting for the show to need a cliff-hanger or something like that.Of course neither the characters nor their threads are strong enough to work if this were a drama series, but thankfully it is not and instead these factors compliment what is otherwise a consistently funny comedy show. The bad memory of season 1 is long gone now as The Office US has settled totally into what it is doing rather than what the UK did – almost to the point where comparison is like comparing apples and potatoes simply because they are both in the same colour box (although of course this is the internet so these arguments will continue forever). I found S3 to be funnier again than S2. The improved narrative threads prevented each episode feeling like a totally contained sketch while the dialogue and observational stuff continues to be frequently funny. I did also like the fact that S3 allowed for more moments where we get to see that the people in the office are not useless even if they are odd characters. The sales call episode is the clearest example of this but there are lots of little moments that offer similar. It is also surprisingly touching at times – again part of the reason that it works best as a sitcom rather than a ""judge me by the laughs"" comedy.Yet again the cast deliver on this well and seem a lot happier doing what they are doing now as opposed to the jobs they were given in season 1. Carell is very good at his role and fits it very well. Fischer continues to be the best at the ""pained"" comedy as she always had been and this skill serves her very well within the comedy and also within her narrative thread. Krasinski is still a bit too much about the mugging for my taste but the lack of complexity or openness in his performance adds realism to a point. He works well with Jones, who is the best of the new additions and helps drive a lot of the character plot. Wilson continues to deliver great lines and a consistently good comedy character. The supporting cast continue to do the good work they did in S2 despite Baker's Stanley looking ever more like a cartoon version of himself. I continue to love Kaling and Bratton but everyone else is good again, with more use of everyone in terms of narrative and comedy (where perhaps S2 used the supporting cast just for comedy asides).",18/23,read comment paper day ago dispute someone claim rock good sitcom moment writer piece blurb feel version office think much opinion see point opinion rock far well comedy get big laugh

371,3,23,9.0,zkonedog,5 July 2019,"To be brutally honest, the second season of this show (the one preceding this one) will most likely be viewed as the funniest of the bunch, as the show was still incredibly fresh and the writers still had a large bank of ideas from which to draw on. Season Three, while still incredibly funny, didn't have quite the extra ""oomph"" that the second season had (what with the incredible Jim & Pam romance). That being said, after finishing this third installment of the show, I actually have gained even more respect for the writers and actors, as they didn't fall into the ""same old, same old"" trap of many comedies and instead kept right on developing the characters we have come to know and love.The biggest change, of course, is the separation of Jim and Pam. As the third season opens, Jim has taken a position at the Stanford branch of Dunder-Mifflin (away from ""beloved"" Scranton) to try and escape the awkwardness of the Pam/Roy relationship (which begins to experience trouble of its own). This move, while losing the playfulness of the interactions of those two characters (which I consider to be the backbone of the entire show), actually serves to give the show more credibility, as you will be pulling even more for the couple to be re-united (whether or not that actually happens is for you to find out!).Another curveball from the previous season is the development of characters from the Stanford branch. While season two essentially takes place almost exclusively inside the Scranton office, this season spends a considerable amount of time following Jim as he meets and interacts with his new co-workers. Again, this may not be what you want to see in the short-term, but it eventually serves to give the show an even stronger base of characters in Andy Bernard and Karen Fillipelli (a potential love-interest for Jim).However, besides the ""loss"" of Jim and Pam for the time being, the rest of the show still rolls along with laugh after laugh. Michael Scott shines brighter than ever, Dwight is still hilarious, and the supporting cast does a remarkable job of keeping themselves relevant to the ongoing storylines.Thus, although this season is a bit weaker than the two previous ones due to the factors described above, I have to give the writers/creators credit for not falling into the trap of repetition and allowing the show to grow stale. Instead, they stretch things in a whole new capacity and, by the end of the season, end up a better show for it going forward.",15/25,brutally honest second season show one precede one likely view funniest bunch show still incredibly fresh writer still large bank idea draw season three still incredibly funny quite extra oomph second season incredible jim_pam romance say finish third installment show actually gain even respect writer actor fall old old trap many comedy instead keep right develop character come know love big change course separation jim_pam third season open jim take position stanford branch dunder_mifflin away beloved scranton try escape awkwardness pam roy relationship begin experience trouble move lose playfulness interaction two character consider backbone entire show actually serve give show credibility pull even couple united whether actually happen find out!).another curveball previous season development character stanford branch season two essentially take place almost exclusively inside scranton office season spend considerable amount time follow jim meet interact new worker may want see short term eventually serve give show even strong base character andy bernard karen fillipelli potential love interest jim).however besides loss jim_pam time rest show still roll along laugh laugh michael_scott shine bright ever dwight still hilarious supporting cast remarkable job keep relevant ongoing storyline thus although season bit weak two previous one due factor describe give writer creator credit fall trap repetition allow show grow stale instead stretch thing whole new capacity end season end well show forward,"['brutally', 'honest', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'one', 'precede', 'one', 'likely', 'view', 'funniest', 'bunch', 'show', 'still', 'incredibly', 'fresh', 'writer', 'still', 'large', 'bank', 'idea', 'draw', 'season', 'three', 'still', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'quite', 'extra', 'oomph', 'second', 'season', 'incredible', 'jim_pam', 'romance', 'say', 'finish', 'third', 'installment', 'show', 'actually', 'gain', 'even', 'respect', 'writer', 'actor', 'fall', 'old', 'old', 'trap', 'many', 'comedy', 'instead', 'keep', 'right', 'develop', 'character', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'big', 'change', 'course', 'separation', 'jim_pam', 'third', 'season', 'open', 'jim', 'take', 'position', 'stanford', 'branch', 'dunder_mifflin', 'away', 'beloved', 'scranton', 'try', 'escape', 'awkwardness', 'pam', 'roy', 'relationship', 'begin', 'experience', 'trouble', 'move', 'lose', 'playfulness', 'interaction', 'two', 'character', 'consider', 'backbone', 'entire', 'show', 'actually', 'serve', 'give', 'show', 'credibility', 'pull', 'even', 'couple', 'united', 'whether', 'actually', 'happen', 'find', 'out!).another', 'curveball', 'previous', 'season', 'development', 'character', 'stanford', 'branch', 'season', 'two', 'essentially', 'take', 'place', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'inside', 'scranton', 'office', 'season', 'spend', 'considerable', 'amount', 'time', 'follow', 'jim', 'meet', 'interact', 'new', 'worker', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'short', 'term', 'eventually', 'serve', 'give', 'show', 'even', 'strong', 'base', 'character', 'andy', 'bernard', 'karen', 'fillipelli', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'jim).however', 'besides', 'loss', 'jim_pam', 'time', 'rest', 'show', 'still', 'roll', 'along', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'michael_scott', 'shine', 'bright', 'ever', 'dwight', 'still', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'cast', 'remarkable', 'job', 'keep', 'relevant', 'ongoing', 'storyline', 'thus', 'although', 'season', 'bit', 'weak', 'two', 'previous', 'one', 'due', 'factor', 'describe', 'give', 'writer', 'creator', 'credit', 'fall', 'trap', 'repetition', 'allow', 'show', 'grow', 'stale', 'instead', 'stretch', 'thing', 'whole', 'new', 'capacity', 'end', 'season', 'end', 'well', 'show', 'forward']"

Having Jim get transferred to the other office was great. Having the other office close and having Jim return to Scranton was overkill. The overuse of the Jim/Pam romance has gone beyond trite and predictable. The greatness of ""The Office"" was its unpredictability and its irrelevant humor.Last year's season opener was the brilliant and hilarious ""Gay Witch Project."" This hour long season opener entitled ""The Fun Run,"" is bloated and unfunny. The writers took the predictable path with Jim and Pam and have used it has the focal point of the office. There's no place for that to go now. But with the juvenile and annoying behavior expressed by Jim and Pam in the second half of last year, I can only say that they deserve each other. But as a viewer, it's starting to get real sickening. The writer's also took the easy way out by getting rid of Karen, just like they did with Roy last year.

Most regular watchers probably viewed this switch back with a mixture of emotions, because it has been a joy to have an hour of The Office every week, but I think there's a part of most people that know the hour-long slots are best saved for the really pivotal episodes that need that much more time for exposition.This episode was a great example of the love/hate relationship that probably a lot of us have with Michael Scott. Steve Carell imbues Michael with those glimpses of vulnerability that make us keep coming back and putting up with him, but there are still those moments that just make you want to throttle Michael Scott. For me, in this episode, it was the really fun theme song Darryl was putting together with the other singers in the office... and frankly, if Michael had gone with it, it might just have been what convinced David Wallace to allow them to go with their own ad. But, then again, he wouldn't have been Michael Scott if he HAD gone with it.The writers are doing a great job at doling out the Pam/Jim relationship in small doses. This is one of the first times a series has succeeded in keeping a successful relationship interesting once it is official (of course, they are using the Dwight/Angela/Andy plot to sustain that area of tension.Questions that are starting to surface for this season, have to do with past characters: Is Karen Filippelli going to make any more appearances. Here's a piece of trivia on Rashida Jones - she sang a capella in college. Will she maybe hook up with Andy at a singing conference? (probably not, Karen seemed to have objections to singing (Diwali/Initiation).Where will we see Roy again? Will Pam and Jim run into him at some inopportune time?

469,4,14,,bob the moo,6 June 2009,"As I'm late to the party I am only hitting season 4 of The Office now and of course this means, as it did with 30 Rock, that I am now at the period that was affected by the writers' strike – which means that this season is a lot shorter than it should have been, even if it does have quite a few extended episodes in there to make it a bit longer than the 14 episode list would suggest. I'm not sure if this effected the show negatively but certainly something doesn't appear to be clicking in the early stages. Where season 3 had moved on from season 2 with a jump in time that worked, the action between 3 and 4 doesn't seem to transition that well and it hurts the show that does rely on a narrative structure and characters in a way that the quicker hitting 30 Rock does not. Happily it does settle in quite quickly and the majority of the episodes are pretty good with solid laughs and engaging enough events.Some of the episodes and threads of the show are excellent as they capture the awkward (but not painful like the UK version) comedy of this workplace but it is some of the narrative that don't work as well as they did in seasons 2 and 3. Jim and Pam's relationship is the most obvious one. The writers appear to have gone from being able to perfectly nail the detail of their back and forwards to suddenly deciding to move things rapidly forward while assuming the viewers will just go with it because that is what we want to see. However in doing this they move things way too fast so that not only does it not quite convince but we also don't get to enjoy them being a dating couple the way that we enjoyed them being flirty for so long. Not so much of a big deal is Ryan's new role. Again perhaps the short season is to blame but this seems to move too fast without enough done with it beyond the obvious. Michael and Jan provides good laughs but Andy and Angela didn't convince me as it just seemed written for the sake of having events and it was only Dwight's part in it that made me enjoy it (I find him funny).The cast continue to be good though and most do well with a bit of added pathos to their roles. Carell wears his character really well and while his terrible judgement is endearing, he avoids making it so painful that we cannot find it funny – which we do. Fischer continues to be one of my favourite parts of the show and it is not her fault that the material rushes her along – she is best when shocked by Michael. Krasinski is still a necessary evil in my opinion. His comedy is mostly responding to other people and this puts him more on the spot in regards the relationship plot – which, not his fault, is not as good this season. Wilson has great lines while Kaling's valley-girl personae makes for wonderful little moments – as do Flannery, Bratton, Baumgartner, Baker and so on. I'm not sure about Novak though – he doesn't seem to fit in that well and is not used that well as a character – perhaps too close to the material as a person? Although I have specified a lot of negative things, I must say that I enjoyed season 4. OK it is not as engaging nor as funny as seasons 2 and 3 but it is still good enough to make The Office stand up as a great sitcom with comedy and situations working well enough. Hopefully this does not represent a ""slide"" towards diminishing returns and I do look forward to season 5 (as soon as I can work out who is going to get it for me since ITV is about 4 years away from showing it if at all!).",13/23,late party hit season office course mean rock period affect writer strike mean season lot short even quite extended episode make bit long episode list would suggest sure effect show negatively certainly something appear click early stage season move season jump time work action seem transition well hurt show rely narrative structure character way quick hit rock happily settle quite quickly majority episode pretty good solid laugh engage enough event episode thread show excellent capture awkward painful like version comedy workplace narrative work well season jim_pam relationship obvious one writer appear able perfectly nail detail back forwards suddenly decide move thing rapidly forward assume viewer want see however move thing way fast quite convince also get enjoy date couple way enjoy flirty long much big deal ryan new role perhaps short season blame seem move fast without enough beyond obvious michael jan provide good laugh andy angela convince seem write sake event dwight part make enjoy find funny).the cast continue good though well bit add pathos role carell wear character really well terrible judgement endear avoid make painful find funny fischer continue one favourite part show fault material rush along good shock michael krasinski still necessary evil opinion comedy mostly respond people put spot regard relationship plot fault good season wilson great line kaling valley girl personae make wonderful little moment flannery bratton baumgartner baker sure novak though seem fit well use well character perhaps close material person although specify lot negative thing must say enjoy season engage funny season still good enough make office stand great sitcom comedy situation work well enough hopefully represent slide towards diminishing return look_forward season soon work get since itv year away show,"['late', 'party', 'hit', 'season', 'office', 'course', 'mean', 'rock', 'period', 'affect', 'writer', 'strike', 'mean', 'season', 'lot', 'short', 'even', 'quite', 'extended', 'episode', 'make', 'bit', 'long', 'episode', 'list', 'would', 'suggest', 'sure', 'effect', 'show', 'negatively', 'certainly', 'something', 'appear', 'click', 'early', 'stage', 'season', 'move', 'season', 'jump', 'time', 'work', 'action', 'seem', 'transition', 'well', 'hurt', 'show', 'rely', 'narrative', 'structure', 'character', 'way', 'quick', 'hit', 'rock', 'happily', 'settle', 'quite', 'quickly', 'majority', 'episode', 'pretty', 'good', 'solid', 'laugh', 'engage', 'enough', 'event', 'episode', 'thread', 'show', 'excellent', 'capture', 'awkward', 'painful', 'like', 'version', 'comedy', 'workplace', 'narrative', 'work', 'well', 'season', 'jim_pam', 'relationship', 'obvious', 'one', 'writer', 'appear', 'able', 'perfectly', 'nail', 'detail', 'back', 'forwards', 'suddenly', 'decide', 'move', 'thing', 'rapidly', 'forward', 'assume', 'viewer', 'want', 'see', 'however', 'move', 'thing', 'way', 'fast', 'quite', 'convince', 'also', 'get', 'enjoy', 'date', 'couple', 'way', 'enjoy', 'flirty', 'long', 'much', 'big', 'deal', 'ryan', 'new', 'role', 'perhaps', 'short', 'season', 'blame', 'seem', 'move', 'fast', 'without', 'enough', 'beyond', 'obvious', 'michael', 'jan', 'provide', 'good', 'laugh', 'andy', 'angela', 'convince', 'seem', 'write', 'sake', 'event', 'dwight', 'part', 'make', 'enjoy', 'find', 'funny).the', 'cast', 'continue', 'good', 'though', 'well', 'bit', 'add', 'pathos', 'role', 'carell', 'wear', 'character', 'really', 'well', 'terrible', 'judgement', 'endear', 'avoid', 'make', 'painful', 'find', 'funny', 'fischer', 'continue', 'one', 'favourite', 'part', 'show', 'fault', 'material', 'rush', 'along', 'good', 'shock', 'michael', 'krasinski', 'still', 'necessary', 'evil', 'opinion', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'respond', 'people', 'put', 'spot', 'regard', 'relationship', 'plot', 'fault', 'good', 'season', 'wilson', 'great', 'line', 'kaling', 'valley', 'girl', 'personae', 'make', 'wonderful', 'little', 'moment', 'flannery', 'bratton', 'baumgartner', 'baker', 'sure', 'novak', 'though', 'seem', 'fit', 'well', 'use', 'well', 'character', 'perhaps', 'close', 'material', 'person', 'although', 'specify', 'lot', 'negative', 'thing', 'must', 'say', 'enjoy', 'season', 'engage', 'funny', 'season', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'office', 'stand', 'great', 'sitcom', 'comedy', 'situation', 'work', 'well', 'enough', 'hopefully', 'represent', 'slide', 'towards', 'diminishing', 'return', 'look_forward', 'season', 'soon', 'work', 'get', 'since', 'itv', 'year', 'away', 'show']"

472,4,14,10.0,zkonedog,5 July 2019,"Though the third season of ""The Office"" was, for the most part, still hilarious television at its finest, it sort of diverged from what made the show so endearing...the relationships. While I commended the writers for doing such a thing to bring new life into the show, I also have to say that Season Four was a welcome return to what The Office does best.Despite being cut to just 14 episodes do to the TV Writer's strike of 2007-2008, this season manages to still provide a laugh a minute while also getting back to the core of the series, that being the relationships such as Jim/Pam and Dwight/Angela. Michael Scott keeps doing his hilarious thing, but what sets The Office apart from all other comedy sitcoms is its ability to keep developing the characters and maintaining its quality level (e.g. not turning into a soap opera).

474,4,14,10.0,PWNYCNY,7 August 2018,"Great episode. Lots of humor but also has a serious side. Jim pays Phyllis to make an extravagant go away party for Toby. He does this not because he cares about Toby, but because of an ulterior motive: he wants to create a spectacular setting to propose marriage to Pam. The audience is left wondering when will Jim do the deed. The tension builds as Michael develops an infatuation with the new HR person Holly. Finally, the party is going full blast and everybody is having a great time. Of course, complications develop. Michael gets word that Jan is in town. he leaves the party, meets Jan who is pregnant. Believing that he is the father, Michael is flabbergasted and ecstatic until Jan tells him she pregnant by artificial insemination. Michael is devastated. he returns to the party. Holly hints that she wants Michael to leave with her; Michael, now depressed, declines and she leaves with Kevin. Meanwhile, Jim takes out the ring from his pocket but is hesitant about proposing to Pam. While Jim is procrastinating, Andy grabs the mike and publicly proposes marriage to Angela, thus completely upstaging Jim who puts the ring away, completely deflated. All attention shifts to Andy. Andy, who is a buffoon, shows that he has more courage than Jim, and proves it on Jim's dime. What a come down for Jim. He was planning to be the star, and it doesn't happen. The lesson of this episode: he who hesitates pays the price. Andy upstages Dwight as well. Dwight is stunned. His sense of superiority is crushed. He took Angela for granted, and now lost her to an interloper. Later on, Dwight recovers and regroups. He understands his mistake. There is no way he will give up Angela. After the party Phyllis returns to the office and catches Dwight and Angela having sex. As for Jim, the nature of his relationship with Pam is still ambiguous. There is no question that it is at risk of ending. Pam cares for Jim and sensed that Jim wanted to propose. But if actions speak louder than words, Jim's inaction speaks volumes. Does he really care about her? Even more importantly, does Jim have what it takes to be a leader? His status as the office's star is also at risk.

475,4,14,8.0,katyayan-,2 October 2021,"Review By Kamal KSteve Carell continues to prove why he's such a star. As the center of this show, he manages to expand and deepen Michael Scott in a way that most actors would find impossible. Michael alternates between lovable idiot and insufferable cad - sometimes in the same scene. There are several priceless moments in this episode, but watching Michael listen to the stenographer read back the discussion of what he meant by ""That's what she said"" is one of the funniest moments in the series so far.I dislike Ryan in his new corporate job. Yes, I get they were trying to make him obscenely obnoxious, but none of this makes sense to me. There's no real reason the show gives for hiring a night school business major with no real sales experience to suddenly oversee multiple branches of a mid-sized paper firm. He's not a good people person, and every time he shows up I beg the TV for someone to slap him. They kind of wrap up his storyline offscreen, too, which felt very unrewarding when you wanted to see in person him getting his comeuppance.Season 4 ended with a slight change to the status quo, with the departure of Toby and the introduction of Holly Flax, the new H. R. rep and Michael's instant love-crush. Jan ends up announcing that she's preggers (but not with Michael's baby), Jim almost proposes to Pam,and Andy definitely proposes to Angela.",0/1,review kamal ksteve_carell continue prove star center show manage expand deepen michael_scott way actor would find impossible michael alternate lovable idiot insufferable cad sometimes scene several priceless moment episode watch michael listen stenographer read back discussion mean say one funniest moment series far dislike ryan new corporate job yes get try make obscenely obnoxious none make sense real reason show give hire night school business major real sale experience suddenly oversee multiple branch mid sized paper firm good people person every time show beg someone slap kind wrap storyline offscreen feel unrewarding want see person get comeuppance season end slight change status quo departure toby introduction holly flax new rep michael instant love crush jan end announce pregger michael baby jim almost propose pam andy definitely propose angela,"['review', 'kamal', 'ksteve_carell', 'continue', 'prove', 'star', 'center', 'show', 'manage', 'expand', 'deepen', 'michael_scott', 'way', 'actor', 'would', 'find', 'impossible', 'michael', 'alternate', 'lovable', 'idiot', 'insufferable', 'cad', 'sometimes', 'scene', 'several', 'priceless', 'moment', 'episode', 'watch', 'michael', 'listen', 'stenographer', 'read', 'back', 'discussion', 'mean', 'say', 'one', 'funniest', 'moment', 'series', 'far', 'dislike', 'ryan', 'new', 'corporate', 'job', 'yes', 'get', 'try', 'make', 'obscenely', 'obnoxious', 'none', 'make', 'sense', 'real', 'reason', 'show', 'give', 'hire', 'night', 'school', 'business', 'major', 'real', 'sale', 'experience', 'suddenly', 'oversee', 'multiple', 'branch', 'mid', 'sized', 'paper', 'firm', 'good', 'people', 'person', 'every', 'time', 'show', 'beg', 'someone', 'slap', 'kind', 'wrap', 'storyline', 'offscreen', 'feel', 'unrewarding', 'want', 'see', 'person', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'season', 'end', 'slight', 'change', 'status', 'quo', 'departure', 'toby', 'introduction', 'holly', 'flax', 'new', 'rep', 'michael', 'instant', 'love', 'crush', 'jan', 'end', 'announce', 'pregger', 'michael', 'baby', 'jim', 'almost', 'propose', 'pam', 'andy', 'definitely', 'propose', 'angela']"

Not the case with this episode. I recently rewatched the entire series and let me say, no episode holds a candle to ""Goddbye, Toby."" Let's start with the somewhat hyped new character who comes aboard. The new HR rep, Holly, is brilliant. Without spoiling, she adds a dynamic for many characters, notably Kevin and Michael (and Creed!) that can't be beaten. Every character (aside from Dwight) gets a good moment this episode, and every storyline that has been building gets a major push forward. As with the last two season finales the last scene is shocking and amazing and throughly mouth-gaping yet side-splitting.Phyllis, a character who often is dismissed by her cohorts, earns her stripes and becomes a very lovable character. Toby is throughly hazed by Michael in moments that make the awkwardness a drug for the viewers. Pam and Jim get some sweet moments, too. Andy of course, screws things up, but you can't help but love him. Angela is of course ridiculous, and even Meredith gets a good moment. And it doesn't stop there. The Temp, while not actually in the Office, gets an awesome moment... Jan returns, and the Hobbit(!!!) comes back in a deleted scene.Overall, this episode has it all... even in a Ferris Wheel!

482,4,14,9.0,rolltide33,15 May 2008,"This episode really made me laugh after the last few disappointing episodes. Although The Office has been back a while, it felt like it had never really come back. This was the first episode that I could really relate to the first few seasons, which were the best. I was laughing constantly and loved the many plot twists.Two things really upset me in this episode: 1. Jim did not propose. They had us hoping up to the very last minute, but it never happened. I really hated Andy Bernard for a while there! I guess they are just trying to play out Jim and Pam's relationship as long as possible. With Pam heading off to New York for a few months, a possible break up might ensue. I would not be surprised at all if this happened. The producers want the romantic tension, which is better than the flat out romance.2. Michael picked the wrong gal. Every time Michael and the new HR lady started talking, I could just tell that they were meant to be. They were perfect for each other. She understood all his jokes, and didn't make him feel like an idiot. I really wanted to punch Michael in the face when he chose Jan over the new Toby, but I couldn't for technical reasons. Again, the producers want romantic tension.There were a couple big surprises, including Andy proposing to Angela (and Angela accepting?!?!), Dwight and Angela's not-so-secret make out session, and of course Jan's pregnancy. This episode really had it all. I'll miss Toby, going out and buying the most expensive camera around to get a good picture of Pam. But his replacement is well suited for the job and will fit in excellent with the rest of the crew.On of the best sub-plots in this episode was the Holly - Kevin story. I loved how Kevin can act the same way he always does, and Holly still sees him as mentally retarded. I also love the fact that Kevin never caught on, and truly believed Holly was into him and how he wished to ""bang"" her. Kevin is great.The YouTube video of Ryan really got me excited. For one thing, I didn't want Jim to lose his job; and for another, I hated Ryan's guts. I really hope Ryan is gone for good and doesn't come back. The old ""temp"" Ryan was good, but the new Ryan seems to ruin every episode he appears in.Overall, this was a big improvement episode that unfortunately came a little late in the season. Come September, I hope to see Michael getting on track with Holly, and Pam and Jim finally tying things up. I also hope to see Angela and Dwight work things out for good, maybe even buy a new cat together. I have to say that I truly felt sorry for Dwight when he admitted that it was all his fault.Until season 4 starts, I guess I'll just have to hold out on re-runs and the Get Smart movie.

Michael misses Holly and tells Wallace off. Inspite of all that he still makes the sale.Pam has to stay in NYC after she failed a class. Jim is awesome (isn't he always?) and tells her she should stay and take the class even though he wants her to come home so badly. She's really torn up about letting him down but she's going to stick it out. All that would give this maybe a 7 or 8 rating. Keep in mind that's an Office 7 or 8. Not a 7 or 8 compared to what's usually on TV.And then there's the end. Just like in Casino Night, The Job, Niagara, etc. We think we've got an ending and that's when the fun starts. The episode page here at IMDb has the clip. It's one of the prettiest scenes I've ever seen of Jenna. And I'm a huge fan of hers. The lighting has everything to do with it. If you want to know why they call it the ""golden hour"" in film you need look no further than this scene. The sun glows off her hair and face. She's not dressed up like in Casino Night or Niagara.

This review is a 10/10 because the chapter explains it's ends in the most subtle and bittersweet way that i can remember in the series.
Clearly we never get to see the cruelty behind the four walls that take the hard decisions to this point.
Here Michael Scott has to do the supervisor's work of Dunder Mifflin in Scranton to inform David Wallace about a small local company called Prince Family Paper. This company with about 80 clients are going to be victim of the lovable Michael Scott because of the hard competitiveness in the bussiness world and the needless need to improve Dunder Mifflin values in the stock exchange.
Why did Michael and I conclude that this chapter is bittersweet?
Michael because he endured the hard decision-making alone / semi-alone (since Dwight isn't the best guy to discuss morals). And I because i couldn't stand (up to this day) why the office employees were discussing such a dumb thread as an actress being hot or not? How could nobody notice that Michael and Dwight were having serious trouble running around the whole office?
We as a society spend too much time disscusing useless things such as celebrities, sports, or we even take politics to the same discussion level, but finally we never get to do democratically what is correct.

I still think this episode is one of those ones with big name guest stars trying to salvage a script that is so-so compared to other episodes of this series. SorryI had never seen this show prior to it being on after the Super Bowl. This particular post-Super Bowl edition featured Jack Black & Jessica Alba as guest stars. As it is the first show of the series I have watched, it is all new to me.From what I saw here, there must be better shows. This one reminded me of and hour-long poor imitation of Scrubs only the jokes seemed to go from terrible to worse with no rhyme or reason. What I saw is some totally crazy sequences and then it seemed like the show had so many commercial breaks that by the time it got back again, you kind of lost track of where you were anyhow.Jack Black and Alba both were little more than cameos and the guy who worked in the office that initially starts a fire in the beginning of the show must have been a regular because in the real world he would have been fired. In fact, he comes off as a total idiot in this episode.

543,5,13,10.0,vivianla,3 January 2021,Dwight makes a too realistic fire and warmed all the handles so everyone freaks out because they cannot find an exit. Angela has a cat in a drawer. Oscar goes up to the ceiling. It is a horrible show. Stanley gets a heart attack.Dwight then calls out that it was a simulation. Him and Michael speak to corporate due to his actions.A CPR lesson from the Red Cross is carried out. Dwight pulls out a knife after saying they have to check if the victim is an organ donor and stabs the dummy. Poor Stanley gets nauseous. Dwight and Michael go to corporate again.The first half (first episode) is hilarious. The second half (second episode) is about roasting. Michael decides after finding out from Stanley's machine that he stresses people out to do a roast event where his employees roast him. They all go up one by one and roast Michael. Michael sits on a comfortable brown leather chair with a drum in front of him. Pam says she saw Michael naked one time and his thing was small. If it was an iPod it would be a shuffle.After the event Michael walks out and is absent from work.

The biggest improvement is making the show feel real again. The thing I HATED most about the last few episodes was the complete abandonment from reality that they took with the humor and tone. Here, however, the characters are actually behaving more like humans again and doing a lot better acting than they had been lately. Kudos to the writers too for giving them some good dialogue to work with again.I also love that they're trying to really develop the characters as well, particularly with Kevin since he's one of the supporting players I like the most. There feels like there is a progression of a plot again and the focus is more controlled to impromptu and natural laughs rather than bizzaro comedy. Hopefully we can see more developments with some of the other characters since they really butchered some of the great story lines during episodes like The Duel.I think I just love how touched I was with this episode. Yes I know, this isn't supposed to be a drama or anything. However, I think the best comedies are the ones that can make you laugh and cry and that's what I felt happened with this episode. Heck, I think the drama gave the comedy in this a little more impact since it felt like a natural relief of tension.If things continue to improve with the next few episodes, we may just have a return to form with The Office. I've tried to say that previous episodes were a step in the right direction, but this truly is one because it captures what The Office is supposed to be: a look at real life with a slight comedic spin.

And he wants to be loved - as a man and a manager -but shows he's prepared to throw his most loyal supporter under the bus, to save his own backside. And he shows no shame or regret in doing so (not immediately anyway... maybe in the future episodes?).On a side note, even though they have their differences, I loved how Jim stands up for Dwight. He's showing REAL management qualities there.When this sort of thing happens IRL (ie your manager tries to chuck YOU under the bus to save themselves), you probably have much less empathy, and lose any shred of respect you have left for them. What I liked most about this episode is that normally you're rooting for Michael, and in this one you find yourself embarrassed and appalled by his behaviour.

Steve Carell dominates the story and succeeds in conveying Michael's desperate attempt to maintain his dignity under challenging circumstances. The episode also dramatizes how tenuous and superficial are the interpersonal relationships at work, as the office staff reacts with indifference to Michael's imminent departure. Nobody supports him as he is being replaced, his loyalty and devotion to the office staff not reciprocated, his appeal for support rebuffed. Although the story has humour, it is dark humour. Michael is being replaced, he is being treated shabbily, yet he does not want to go out without a fight. To retaliate he wants to start his own company which has little chance of succeeding. But selling is his life, it is what he knows best, for Michael is a leader who has his workers' back because he is a worker himself.

However, for some reason, I always really liked it. In so many ways, Michael's histrionics consistently drive our amusement with this show, but this ep truly showcased an element of maturity and professionalism in our protagonist that is often rarely seen. Of course, in the beginning, we're forced to observe typical ""Michael"", who spends the first portion of the episode moping and feeling insecure about his sudden career loss. This consequently forces Pam to take charge and try and motivate her boss. However, by the end, Pam's frustrations have clearly mounted, and her inexperience altogether consumes her initial optimism. Yet, conversely, Michael, who is more adept to leadership, becomes the one who takes charge by having to console Pam. In reassuring his faithful employee (who refuses to exit a vehicle in a petulant, childlike tantrum) and conveying his overall game plan, Michael exposes an impressively no-nonsense, authoritative demeanor that illustrates his strong ability to often take the reins and get things done. In other words, we finally see why Michael is the boss. Unfortunately, because his character is utilized so often for comical purposes, we rarely get to see this side of Michael Scott.

640,5,26,,bob the moo,30 September 2009,"Although the pretty poor first season could be compared to the UK original, The Office US quickly became its own beast in the second and subsequent seasons. This should be kept in mind because while the UK version ran for about 12 episodes and some extended specials, the US version is approaching 100 episodes. Season 4 perhaps started to show the strain a little bit but this fifth season is the first one where there appears to have been a change in approach that is noticeable. Mostly, The Office story lines in the past have been about the office as a place – a place where day to day things happen which are work-related and, within this, you have people and their lives – but the narrative for each episode was mostly structured and driven by these internal events. Season 5 sees things become much more driven by these characters and the relationships within the office.This change is not massive but it is telling. The Office was always more of a standard sitcom than the much more scatological type of sitcom of 30 Rock but with 100 or so episodes down it has become more reliant on the characters to make the stories rather than them just being in the story. Thus we have engagements, affairs, lost love, broken hearts, sackings etc. Mostly these work because it is not yet at the point where strain is showing like it does in some shows where the constant plot twists involving old characters and new additions start to make it seem silly. It must be said that it doesn't quite have the lightness that it once did and the plot does occasionally seem a bit contrived or convenient but it does still work well enough to support the show.That it is still funny is the main thing that makes ti work though. The asides are still very good, the minor characters doing asides are very good and I still had fun with each episode. It isn't the laugh fest that it may once have been given the work now being put into creating plots and threads but the writers have not forgotten what about the show viewers come for. The cast continue to do well with the material and indeed some do better with more of a character driven piece. Carell continues to be good. He gives us enough of the fool to make it easy to laugh at Michael but always knows when to humanise him and keep the viewers on his side despite himself (much like Pam does with him). Speaking of Pam Fischer also does well with her character despite her going down a series of threads that don't totally work but keep her to the fore, which is not something I always appreciated. Krasinski is nicely charming as before and has grown on me and he works well with his relationship dynamic. Wilson's thread is a bit strained but he continues to be the best provider of asides and laughs. Novak is feeling more and more like baggage in the cast and he doesn't have much to do but it is like the show is afraid not to have him. Baker, Smith, Kaling, Nunez, Bratton and the others continue to be a very reliable support cast of characters.Overall season 5 does show a bit of the strain of being such a long running show in terms of the writing of the plots but the show remains engaging and funny enough to cover these minor issues. It isn't the best of the seasons but it is not far below the bar and viewers who have followed it for the whole run will have no reason not to look forward to season 6.",17/25,although pretty poor first season could compare original office quickly become beast second subsequent season keep mind version run episode extended special version approach 000 episode season perhaps start show strain little_bit fifth season first one appear change approach noticeable mostly office story line past office place place day day thing happen work relate within people life narrative episode mostly structure drive internal event season see thing become much drive character relationship within office change massive tell office always standard sitcom much scatological type sitcom rock 000 episode become reliant character make story rather story thus engagement affair lose love broken heart sacking etc mostly work yet point strain show like show constant plot twist involve old character new addition start make seem silly must say quite lightness plot occasionally seem bit contrived convenient still work well enough support show still funny main thing make work though aside still good minor character aside good still fun episode laugh fest may give work put create plot thread writer forget show viewer come cast continue well material indeed well character drive piece carell continue good give enough fool make easy laugh michael always know humanise keep viewer side despite much like pam speak pam fischer also well character despite series thread totally work keep fore something always appreciate krasinski nicely charming grow work well relationship dynamic wilson thread bit strained continue good provider aside laugh novak feel like baggage cast much like show afraid baker smith kaling nunez bratton continue reliable support cast character overall season show bit strain long running show term writing plot show remain engaging funny enough cover minor issue good season far bar viewer follow whole run reason look_forward season,"['although', 'pretty', 'poor', 'first', 'season', 'could', 'compare', 'original', 'office', 'quickly', 'become', 'beast', 'second', 'subsequent', 'season', 'keep', 'mind', 'version', 'run', 'episode', 'extended', 'special', 'version', 'approach', '000', 'episode', 'season', 'perhaps', 'start', 'show', 'strain', 'little_bit', 'fifth', 'season', 'first', 'one', 'appear', 'change', 'approach', 'noticeable', 'mostly', 'office', 'story', 'line', 'past', 'office', 'place', 'place', 'day', 'day', 'thing', 'happen', 'work', 'relate', 'within', 'people', 'life', 'narrative', 'episode', 'mostly', 'structure', 'drive', 'internal', 'event', 'season', 'see', 'thing', 'become', 'much', 'drive', 'character', 'relationship', 'within', 'office', 'change', 'massive', 'tell', 'office', 'always', 'standard', 'sitcom', 'much', 'scatological', 'type', 'sitcom', 'rock', '000', 'episode', 'become', 'reliant', 'character', 'make', 'story', 'rather', 'story', 'thus', 'engagement', 'affair', 'lose', 'love', 'broken', 'heart', 'sacking', 'etc', 'mostly', 'work', 'yet', 'point', 'strain', 'show', 'like', 'show', 'constant', 'plot', 'twist', 'involve', 'old', 'character', 'new', 'addition', 'start', 'make', 'seem', 'silly', 'must', 'say', 'quite', 'lightness', 'plot', 'occasionally', 'seem', 'bit', 'contrived', 'convenient', 'still', 'work', 'well', 'enough', 'support', 'show', 'still', 'funny', 'main', 'thing', 'make', 'work', 'though', 'aside', 'still', 'good', 'minor', 'character', 'aside', 'good', 'still', 'fun', 'episode', 'laugh', 'fest', 'may', 'give', 'work', 'put', 'create', 'plot', 'thread', 'writer', 'forget', 'show', 'viewer', 'come', 'cast', 'continue', 'well', 'material', 'indeed', 'well', 'character', 'drive', 'piece', 'carell', 'continue', 'good', 'give', 'enough', 'fool', 'make', 'easy', 'laugh', 'michael', 'always', 'know', 'humanise', 'keep', 'viewer', 'side', 'despite', 'much', 'like', 'pam', 'speak', 'pam', 'fischer', 'also', 'well', 'character', 'despite', 'series', 'thread', 'totally', 'work', 'keep', 'fore', 'something', 'always', 'appreciate', 'krasinski', 'nicely', 'charming', 'grow', 'work', 'well', 'relationship', 'dynamic', 'wilson', 'thread', 'bit', 'strained', 'continue', 'good', 'provider', 'aside', 'laugh', 'novak', 'feel', 'like', 'baggage', 'cast', 'much', 'like', 'show', 'afraid', 'baker', 'smith', 'kaling', 'nunez', 'bratton', 'continue', 'reliable', 'support', 'cast', 'character', 'overall', 'season', 'show', 'bit', 'strain', 'long', 'running', 'show', 'term', 'writing', 'plot', 'show', 'remain', 'engaging', 'funny', 'enough', 'cover', 'minor', 'issue', 'good', 'season', 'far', 'bar', 'viewer', 'follow', 'whole', 'run', 'reason', 'look_forward', 'season']"

643,5,26,10.0,zkonedog,5 July 2019,"After watching four seasons of ""The Office"", what I was consistently amazed at was the show's ability to stray away from the formula in order to cultivate new territory. For example, during a large portion of the third season Jim and Pam (the emotional backbone of the show) are separated and lose that incredible chemistry. However, that separation ends up bringing in the Andy Bernard character, who has been a wonderful addition to the show.This fifth season did much of the same. It started off great, especially when Michael Scott finds a new employee, Holly, who can match him step for step in the craziness department. Each episode contains at least one absolutely hilarious moment (and some come once every few seconds!), even despite the fact that the ""same old"" cast is back again. However, as the season approaches roughly the 2/3rds mark, there are some major changes that take place, primarily for Michael and Pam Beasley. This creates a run of 5-6 episodes that, to be honest, just aren't as hilariously funny as the rest of them (as Jim Halpert's character cannot hold the show in lieu of Michael).However, as they so often do, the writers take that disturbing change and eventually make it work out for the better, as the emotional sides of many of ""The Office"" workers are touched on more than ever before, what with all the changes occurring. When the show finally gets back to its original pattern/format, it feels like slipping into that old familiar spot on the couch again...you might take it for granted while you have it, but removing it from your life will just make you want it back that much more!Thus, I once again give this season of ""The Office"" my highest approval for its ability to be incredibly funny and still develop characters in a meaningful way.",11/15,watch four season office consistently amazed show ability stray away formula order cultivate new territory example large portion third season jim_pam emotional backbone show separate lose incredible chemistry however separation end bring andy bernard character wonderful addition show fifth season much start great especially michael_scott find new employee holly match step step craziness department episode contain least one absolutely hilarious moment come every second even despite fact old cast back however season approach roughly 0/0rds mark major change take place primarily michael pam beasley create run episode honest hilariously funny rest jim halpert character hold show lieu michael).however often writer take disturbing change eventually make work well emotional side many office worker touch ever change occur show finally get back original pattern format feel like slip old familiar spot couch may take grant remove life make want back much more!thus give season office high approval ability incredibly funny still develop character meaningful way,"['watch', 'four', 'season', 'office', 'consistently', 'amazed', 'show', 'ability', 'stray', 'away', 'formula', 'order', 'cultivate', 'new', 'territory', 'example', 'large', 'portion', 'third', 'season', 'jim_pam', 'emotional', 'backbone', 'show', 'separate', 'lose', 'incredible', 'chemistry', 'however', 'separation', 'end', 'bring', 'andy', 'bernard', 'character', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'show', 'fifth', 'season', 'much', 'start', 'great', 'especially', 'michael_scott', 'find', 'new', 'employee', 'holly', 'match', 'step', 'step', 'craziness', 'department', 'episode', 'contain', 'least', 'one', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'come', 'every', 'second', 'even', 'despite', 'fact', 'old', 'cast', 'back', 'however', 'season', 'approach', 'roughly', '0/0rds', 'mark', 'major', 'change', 'take', 'place', 'primarily', 'michael', 'pam', 'beasley', 'create', 'run', 'episode', 'honest', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'rest', 'jim', 'halpert', 'character', 'hold', 'show', 'lieu', 'michael).however', 'often', 'writer', 'take', 'disturbing', 'change', 'eventually', 'make', 'work', 'well', 'emotional', 'side', 'many', 'office', 'worker', 'touch', 'ever', 'change', 'occur', 'show', 'finally', 'get', 'back', 'original', 'pattern', 'format', 'feel', 'like', 'slip', 'old', 'familiar', 'spot', 'couch', 'may', 'take', 'grant', 'remove', 'life', 'make', 'want', 'back', 'much', 'more!thus', 'give', 'season', 'office', 'high', 'approval', 'ability', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'still', 'develop', 'character', 'meaningful', 'way']"

653,6,1,7.0,maine_310,17 September 2009,"Moral of the storyGossip must not be used to one's own advantage, people can get hurt.Michael could have avoided all the drama had he just said the gossip was a moral lesson for the interns before they left, but that would have been too easy to get by, especially when it came to Michael.So we have this episode starting off with the only two guys capable of following after Michael's clownish ways by prancing about the office like madmen. Are Dwight and Andy a similar version of Michael or do they have their own hidden agendas for acting so silly. How did Michael get by running this office.I now understand why interns were hardly brought on 'The Office'. Who ever thought that when they grew up they always wanted to work in 'The Office', maybe the show. Seriously though the thought wouldn't really cross your mind as a big career choice, so what were those interns thinking? Not to mention the basis of this episode 'Gossip', where the interns caught Stanley and Cynthia(a.k.a. not the wife) together on a non work afternoon. It wasn't only the juiciest Gossip of all, it also sent all those crazy flags and twisted antennas up on Michael's radar. He would have been the hero of gossip if he distributed that juicy detail, despite the repercussions. I didn't know what was more amusing; the fact that Michael spread the piece of compromising gossip about as though he was sharing candy to hungry children, or that he enjoyed giving away the news simply because he had the upper hand, both amusing, but the end result sure would have been nasty.Topping it off with a cherry; when Stanley warned Michael not to tell everyone his big secret, which he already did, he began spreading other gossip he believed to be false which ironically turned out to be true.What a perfect opportunity to reveal Jim and Pam's pregnancy, Andy's not so straight side and Kelly's eating disorder, some of the few lies Michael twisted and he nailed the draw dropper about Jim and Pam. So does this mean some gossip is based on an element of truth. I mean look how easily Michael guessed it. When Andy began talking about Brad Pitt, I really wondered. (Brad Pitt has been used so many times, so many ways, I wonder what goes through his mind when he hears his name being called over and over, it must be tiring or he probably couldn't care less)... and Kelly did have that break down in 'Weight Loss' Season 5 Episode 1.What was Michael thinking? If he spread more lies, the truth would eventually pail in comparison and become the lie itself (Sounds Michael enough). It made sense only if he stuck to it. What was Stanley thinking, asking Michael to keep his secret? He was actually believable denying it when Michael first asked him if he was having an affair (Makes you wonder). Micheal was ready to out him when his butt was on the line and last season's cliff hanger about Jim and Pam's pregnancy was revealed to the entire office with the sonogram as proof. Did that slap Michael in the face as well? It all turned out in vein, revealing the pregnancy, Michael still outed Stanley in the end... poor car.Maybe Jim and Pam should have just let Michael tell them.So last season wasn't the big hit we enjoyed as 'The Office' took a different turn and I would admit I laughed a bit more than usual in this half hour and I really felt sorry for those interns... I hardly doubt we'd be seeing their faces again, probably in the world of show biz as Jet Lee, Julia Stiles and Alan Thicke, maybe the Jet Lee was more believable.Lexa Reviews

660,6,2,8.0,maine_310,24 September 2009,"Running an office is just about as easy as trying to turn a straight corner; easy to figure out it's complete difficulty and that it's nearly impossible.Michael still doesn't have the hand of things and this meeting between Jim and David pushes the unstable front and lack of control Michael displays. Jim believed that keeping Michael out of the loop was for his own benefit, but that also showed carelessness on Jim's part seeing as Michael has the attention span of a five year old and by keeping him out of the loop only meant that he would want to get closer to the root of things. The entire time I kept wondering why would Jim depend on Michael at all.Sometimes I just expect nothing less or nothing more out the the character Steve Carell plays. He has an eccentric way of making Michael come off as completely silly and unique at the same time, there is simply no other character like him on the television I've grown to admire. Michael is just an overgrown lad and I do believe 'The Office' represents something bizarre and underline, unnoticeable to naked eye, carrying an inner meaning.I haven't quite figured it out yet, but I believe this co-manager was an attempted ploy on Jim's part to supersede Michael. He must have known Michael would go crazy, the co-manager position puts him one step closer. Jim has a lot to loose if he doesn't up his status, especially since he would be a family man soon.Greg Daniels and Aaron Shure have a lot on their plate, but I must commend them for finally putting use to Toby and Darryl some of the most underused characters this season. Spying on Darryl was classic, I truly believed in one split second that Darryl was caught for sure, only to be introduced to a fierce look-a-like. One of the few comedy moments this half hour. Teaming up Toby and Dwight together was sure a better way to go.This season seems to carry a certain storyline, which gives it a measure of consistency. You would have to be a firm 'The Office' watcher to grasp some of the humor thrown our way. I can say I strongly miss Holly in these episodes her storyline is unresolved, even though it might not be best placed here with the theme the writers are taking on. I am still interested in next weeks' installment.BONUS Quotes Toby: ""Hey you ass**** you going to eat all that dog food yourself"" Who knew Toby had it in him. For a moment there I believed Darryl was innocent. In no way was this meant to sound harsh, but was that really Darryl's sister?

664,6,3,7.0,maine_310,6 October 2009,"It takes two to tango, but all fall down when there are two bosses to any office. Jim and Michael both hold two completely different prospects into running the office, which caused them to crash dramatically especially when it came to making the tough decisions.What I found most amusing was that I actually believed that Jim was trying to help and not completely take over. Although there were some times where Jim wished he were the only boss, it was only because he believed that his method would work to making the office a more efficient place.Sadly he was most mistaken. Over the years, Michael has been the Charismatic boss; a people pleaser who would back down the second he thought that someone didn't like him.In one day Jim actually believed that taking an Autocratic approach, things could actually change. What makes this storyline intriguing is that it reflects our everyday lifestyle in the workplace, but on a more human-less-comedic manner.Jim failed to realize that the people in the office had grown so accustomed to Michael's people favor ways-unable to ever deliver bad news, that they couldn't even sit back and listen to who was in charge. In a typical work day my boss would announce some cut backs in wages to meet the lower profit margins; you would have one or two complaints but that does nothing at the end of the day-what the boss says goes.Which is why I found it surprising when Jim and Michael hid away from the oddly annoyed workers. No one wants to be the deliverer of bad news.There are many times I thought back to the earlier seasons from 'The Office' and would notice how Jim interacted with Michael; that was the first time they were on the same level of authority and Michael was the one advising him on how the job is done. At the end of the day, we really didn't know what their decision was.Quotes Ryan: ""Question for you would you guys rather have a hundred dollars now or five thousand dollars a year from now"". Maybe Pam should have stock to her first decision, at least the hundred is guaranteed.Jim: ""Michael is my only friend left in the office, except Pam-I think"" Michael: ""Just Pretend we're not here"" Dwight: ""People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great eventually they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later..."" Moments Dwight soiling Jim and Michael's, put a bead on who you think best deserves a raise, plan.

669,6,4,9.0,maine_310,22 October 2009,"Finally it's the big one 'Jim and Pam's Wedding' and everyone from the office is invited. I am sure Jim and Pam could have easily told them a different venue and have their wedding elsewhere with only their family and true friends, dumping the drama down the drain. As much as Jim and Pam may resent working with some real downers, their wedding would not be the same without them. That and they would have creepy phone calls and unending chatter if they stood everyone up.The one thing I loved about this two part episode is that we got to see both sides of the family relating to Jim and Pam. We had some re-occurrences and new faces, but out of all Pam's Grandmother took the cake. I knew someone would have revealed Pam's pregnancy and all eyes would have been on Michael, but the way Jim delivered it '...because of obvious reasons' was essential and in a way unexpected from him.I can tell you for sure that I didn't really peg Dwight to be the stud muffin the writers portrayed him as nor did I ever believe a member of Pam's family would fall head over heals for him. That was an odd twist to the show when Dwight sent Pam's sister away like a one night stand put away like last weeks garbage. I actually felt sorry for her, especially since her taste in men lacked the necessary thrill of the moment. It would have been fun to see Angela and Dwight use the moment to rekindle or deal with whatever flame they once had together. The whole Dwight-Andy-Angela triangle is still unresolved.I honestly commend Jim and Pam for redeeming their marriage at the last moment, every girls dream is to have their wedding at Niagra Falls on the Maid of the Mist...well at least it was for Jim and Pam when they tied the knot, it was one of the most beautiful scenes.

(I had it on TIVO and watched it twice) I loved the fact that they gave Pam and Jim a really romantic wedding (the one you wanted for them) performed by a ship's captain under the Falls, in addition to the big farce with the families (the wedding you personally wanted to see).

He actually seemed like an insurance agent, because  when it comes to Dwight, Michael and Andy, they usually can blow a  simple solution out of proportion.  The one thing we as people learn over the years is that you don't mess  with a newlywed couple on their honeymoon, no matter how dire the  situation is. I am sure Jim and Pam were well aware that Michael would  find a way to interrupt their time away, I think Jim dealt with it the  best. Usually when you are trying to cut someone off you pretend as  though you are breaking up. A little harsh, but calling someone to talk  about the mafia while you are on your honeymoon, I would just hang up.  Knowing Michael would probably keep calling for sport, so it's always  best to just keep the conversation short and stop it from ever  happening again.  I couldn't believe it when Oscar called Jim, I didn't know he relied on  him for office advice so profoundly. So when Michael actually got  intimidated into signing the insurance policy and then backing out when  he believed he wasn't Mafia, I kept wondering why he didn't fear for  his life upon the surface of Dwight and Andy's lie. It's funny how low  they perceive Michael. I probably know what Michael thinks of both Andy  and Dwight. Jim, next time do not leave your social security lying  around, the person that steals your identity could very well be your  best friend, or at least someone you know.

The funny thing is, there was a similar video on 'YouTube' which quoted their Ten Reasons To Watch The Office, so another reason could be that even if you missed a popular clip, you could watch it again on this reminiscent episode of 'The Banker'.If I were to be realistic, I know of other series that have attempted to reuse old clips and make it into a new episode. On those occasions I wasn't intrigued by their approach, The Office bears no exception. I wonder why Toby still works there; he has no hope with Pam and Michael despises his guts, so why bother? There was literally a tiredness and exhausted look on his face, while he was being questioned, I was really tired watching him as well.Dwight claims he doesn't waste company time and envisions himself as a committed employee, but the things he does for Michael sometimes shows of his 'Five Year Old' complex. Did anyone else notice Ryan's glasses and his strange urge to carry of 'The UrKel' look? Is he trying to look more like Dwight or become his sidekick?There was not much advancement with this episode, which was quite disappointing. I don't know if the producers were trying to be cost efficient, or what made this nostalgic episode come about. Maybe they believed the fans would appreciate being reminded of what we love about 'The Office' or probably after the long break they wanted to play 'catch-up' Who knows?

There is no transition between present day and the clips, which makes it confusing, because, for the most part, this is a show that takes place in ONE location.

In fact, a much better way to set this up would be to actually acknowledge for once that there is supposed to be a camera crew filming their daily office lives.

805,6,21,2.0,chrisrowexxx,9 August 2020,"I've watched up to the end of series 7 over lockdown and this is by far the worst episode, the next one isn't great either, it seems they've made Erin and kevin into the standard American cartoon actors, where they're almost parodies of people. I knew Erin was kooky but over this and next episode any like or respect or interest in her completely dies, I assume they chose to as she's with the awful Ed helms and he needs someone on his level. Real shame I liked her, she was daft but then they ruined her.Kevin is obviously an established character and he was always portrayed as bit out there or a bit slow, but ever since the episode where Holly was tricked into the joke that he's special needs they've almost just left him in that state, he used to crack jokes and say dumb stuff but not every word, he's not just an unbearable creepy looking guy screaming a Pam to get her to leak? That's not funny and the humours started drifting from bit out there to down right stupid. Really can't stand the guy anymore, his mannerisms voice and tone just makes me feel his mocking a stereotype and he's just dead as a character now.But the real reason is what I call Joey stupid, in friends joey could get an acting role and remember a script but get confused over something a toddler would get, just forced stupid for the sake of it. They did this with Michael here, I felt a few too many times they took him out of realism to where no real company would keep him on but here it's just ridiculous, with a girl obviously going well then Jim tells him it's a date and the next few minutes just aren't funny or clever just a lot of bad character and character work that ruined this show for me for a while, even Pam lost her charm and Jim to, making her a mom who stands up for herself and Jim as a stressed but confident boss undid a bit of what I loved of them two. I also thought they are the most natural couple with excellent chemistry I've seen in a show and was disappointed how subpar the wedding was. Didn't do them any favours.My only other three hates are Toby i liked the distant but efficient character but he's like a stupid zombie and just don't get it.I knew he wrote some but that BJ Novak is damn awful, he isn't funny, really bad actor just the character with the least everything, fine write it but was so disappointed when they kept bringing him back in, Kelly deserved way better, he was a bad character and an awful actor.Lastly Ed helms was a terrible cast, I know rashida didn't add much and think her dads connections gets her most roles but how Ed helms has had so many roles is beyond me, the guy is awful, he is the same in every film or show, can't act, has no range, isn't funny whatsoever, he can't act like a normal person, the whole way he speaks to just everything about him is ridiculous.

She is in her 20's and she doesn't think that it's possible a man in his 30's could have dated/been engaged to someone before dating her? Seriously.......She throws cake on a co-worker in the middle of the office, she buries her face in her hair and groans in the middle of a restaurant, and she asks Michael some of the most awkward questions possible like ""How many pillows do you sleep with?""I don't mind cringe humor.

830,6,26,,bob the moo,1 June 2010,"It seems that every time I review a season of The Office or 30 Rock, I end up making some comment in regards their comparison. I always say in this little bit that The Office is the better sitcom but that 30 Rock is the funnier show, as the former has more structure and the latter is just constantly looking for the next joke. After a rather disappointing season for 30 Rock (season 4) I started watching this and was glad to find that it continued on the trend laid out in the fifth season where the plots are wider than the office and the work day, but that the office and the characters provide plenty of laughs as a strong foundation.This season sees Pan and Jim have a baby, a new office romance awkwardly stalling its way into existence, a new owner for the company amongst other things and mostly the plots work as threads. Some of them don't quite work as well, mainly because they are threads that have been done already (such as Dwight and Angela) or threads that seem forced for the sake of it (I thought too much was made of Andy and Erin's ""relationship""). Mostly though the show flows pretty well and there isn't anything that drags or falls flat for any length of time – certainly it doesn't feel like a show that has run out of ideas or steam, although it does feel like that perhaps they should not run it for too much longer.I have read other people criticising the show for not being funny in this season, but I'm not sure where they are coming from as the show to me has always been the sitcom that 30 Rock is not. This means that the dialogue is not 100% jokes and barbed zingers as it can often be in that show. This is not to say that it isn't funny though and the documentary approach continues to allow for great asides in interviews and little reaction shots to be captured as well – it is a technique it has used for 6 seasons now and it still produces lots of laughs for me. The cast certainly deliver on this. There are those that are used to great effect for laughs only (Creed being my favourite) but on the other hand it is hard not to appreciate the work that Carell, Wilson, Krasinski and Fischer in particular do in regards the laughs and the narratives. As before the ensemble cast are all great – although my reservations about his threads caused me to not like Helms as much this time round.Season 6 may have had its detractors and perhaps the show is close to coming to an end but for me this was still a very funny and enjoyable season that continues the minor tweaks made in season 5.",20/26,seem every time review season office rock end make comment regard comparison always say little_bit office well sitcom rock funny show former structure latter constantly look next joke rather disappointing season rock season start watch glad find continue trend lay fifth season plot wide office work day office character provide plenty laugh strong foundation season see pan jim baby new office romance awkwardly stall way existence new owner company amongst thing mostly plot work thread quite work well mainly thread already dwight angela thread seem force sake think much make andy erin relationship mostly though show flow pretty well anything drag fall flat length time certainly feel like show run idea steam although feel like perhaps run much long read people criticise show funny season sure come show always sitcom rock mean dialogue 000 joke barb zinger often show say funny though documentary approach continue allow great aside interview little reaction shot capture well technique use season still produce lot laugh cast certainly deliver use great effect laugh creed favourite hand hard appreciate work carell wilson krasinski fischer particular regard laugh narrative ensemble cast great although reservation thread cause like helms much time round season may detractor perhaps show close come end still funny enjoyable season continue minor tweak make season,"['seem', 'every', 'time', 'review', 'season', 'office', 'rock', 'end', 'make', 'comment', 'regard', 'comparison', 'always', 'say', 'little_bit', 'office', 'well', 'sitcom', 'rock', 'funny', 'show', 'former', 'structure', 'latter', 'constantly', 'look', 'next', 'joke', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'season', 'rock', 'season', 'start', 'watch', 'glad', 'find', 'continue', 'trend', 'lay', 'fifth', 'season', 'plot', 'wide', 'office', 'work', 'day', 'office', 'character', 'provide', 'plenty', 'laugh', 'strong', 'foundation', 'season', 'see', 'pan', 'jim', 'baby', 'new', 'office', 'romance', 'awkwardly', 'stall', 'way', 'existence', 'new', 'owner', 'company', 'amongst', 'thing', 'mostly', 'plot', 'work', 'thread', 'quite', 'work', 'well', 'mainly', 'thread', 'already', 'dwight', 'angela', 'thread', 'seem', 'force', 'sake', 'think', 'much', 'make', 'andy', 'erin', 'relationship', 'mostly', 'though', 'show', 'flow', 'pretty', 'well', 'anything', 'drag', 'fall', 'flat', 'length', 'time', 'certainly', 'feel', 'like', 'show', 'run', 'idea', 'steam', 'although', 'feel', 'like', 'perhaps', 'run', 'much', 'long', 'read', 'people', 'criticise', 'show', 'funny', 'season', 'sure', 'come', 'show', 'always', 'sitcom', 'rock', 'mean', 'dialogue', '000', 'joke', 'barb', 'zinger', 'often', 'show', 'say', 'funny', 'though', 'documentary', 'approach', 'continue', 'allow', 'great', 'aside', 'interview', 'little', 'reaction', 'shot', 'capture', 'well', 'technique', 'use', 'season', 'still', 'produce', 'lot', 'laugh', 'cast', 'certainly', 'deliver', 'use', 'great', 'effect', 'laugh', 'creed', 'favourite', 'hand', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'work', 'carell', 'wilson', 'krasinski', 'fischer', 'particular', 'regard', 'laugh', 'narrative', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'great', 'although', 'reservation', 'thread', 'cause', 'like', 'helms', 'much', 'time', 'round', 'season', 'may', 'detractor', 'perhaps', 'show', 'close', 'come', 'end', 'still', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'continue', 'minor', 'tweak', 'make', 'season']"

832,6,26,9.0,zkonedog,5 July 2019,"In reviewing the sixth season of ""The Office"", there is good news and bad news: On the positive side, the season gave us such landmark episodes as ""Niagara Falls"" (Jim/Pam wedding) and ""The Arrival"" (Jim/Pam baby), easily in the top echelon of episodes in show history. On the flip side, though, the show also went through two separate little dry patches that produced some episodes that just didn't measure up well against earlier efforts.The theme of ""change"" runs at the core of the entire season. At the beginning, Dunder-Mifflin employees worry about the long-term stability of their company, then (about half way through the season), the company is actually bought out by Sabre, a printer company headed by Jo Bennett (guest star Kathy Bates), with the crew having to adjust to their new ownership. On a more personal level, the Jim/Pam relationship moves from one of flirtation & fun to more real-life undertones (marriage, parenting, etc.), while two characters (Andy Bernard and new receptionist Erin) become smitten with each other...only to provide some of the most awkwardly hilarious conversations/situations in show history!In terms of acting, the sixth season was on par with the previous installments. Steve Carrell as Michael Scott is still the glue that binds everything together, and the supporting cast keeps turning in hilarious performances when called upon. The introduction of the Andy/Erin romance was a breath of fresh air for the show, as its innocence harkens back to the early Jim/Pam seasons, but due to Andy's total and absolute goofiness, it takes forever (but in a good way!) for things to really get off the ground. About the only two things that got a little annoying were the continued Dwight/Angela battles that never seem to end, and Bates' new character, who doesn't seem to add much comedy to the show whatsoever.So, despite the fact that the episodes were a bit uneven in terms of overall quality/hilarity, I cannot drop this season below five stars due to the extraordinary content of the really good episodes. Basically, the season started off a bit slow, hit its stride during/after the Jim/Pam wedding, then leveled off again after the baby episode, only to limp to the finish line. Also, the final scene hints at the possible return of a fan-favorite character, which could easily rejuvenate the proceedings for the seventh season next fall.",9/12,review sixth season office good news bad news positive side season give landmark episode niagara falls jim_pam wedding arrival jim_pam baby easily top echelon episode show history flip side though show also two separate little dry patch produce episode measure well early effort theme change run core entire season beginning dunder_mifflin employee worry long term stability company half way season company actually buy sabre printer company head bennett guest star kathy bates crew adjust new ownership personal level jim_pam relationship move one flirtation fun real life undertone marriage parenting etc two character andy bernard new receptionist erin become smitten provide awkwardly hilarious conversation situation show history!in term acting sixth season par previous installment steve_carrell michael_scott still glue bind everything together support cast keep turn hilarious performance call upon introduction andy erin romance breath fresh air show innocence harken back early jim_pam season due andy total absolute goofiness take forever good way thing really get ground two thing get little annoying continued dwight angela battle never seem end bates new character seem add much comedy show whatsoever despite fact episode bit uneven term overall quality hilarity drop season five star due extraordinary content really good_episode basically season start bit slow hit stride jim_pam wedding level baby episode limp finish line also final scene hint possible return fan favorite character could easily rejuvenate proceeding seventh season next fall,"['review', 'sixth', 'season', 'office', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'positive', 'side', 'season', 'give', 'landmark', 'episode', 'niagara', 'falls', 'jim_pam', 'wedding', 'arrival', 'jim_pam', 'baby', 'easily', 'top', 'echelon', 'episode', 'show', 'history', 'flip', 'side', 'though', 'show', 'also', 'two', 'separate', 'little', 'dry', 'patch', 'produce', 'episode', 'measure', 'well', 'early', 'effort', 'theme', 'change', 'run', 'core', 'entire', 'season', 'beginning', 'dunder_mifflin', 'employee', 'worry', 'long', 'term', 'stability', 'company', 'half', 'way', 'season', 'company', 'actually', 'buy', 'sabre', 'printer', 'company', 'head', 'bennett', 'guest', 'star', 'kathy', 'bates', 'crew', 'adjust', 'new', 'ownership', 'personal', 'level', 'jim_pam', 'relationship', 'move', 'one', 'flirtation', 'fun', 'real', 'life', 'undertone', 'marriage', 'parenting', 'etc', 'two', 'character', 'andy', 'bernard', 'new', 'receptionist', 'erin', 'become', 'smitten', 'provide', 'awkwardly', 'hilarious', 'conversation', 'situation', 'show', 'history!in', 'term', 'acting', 'sixth', 'season', 'par', 'previous', 'installment', 'steve_carrell', 'michael_scott', 'still', 'glue', 'bind', 'everything', 'together', 'support', 'cast', 'keep', 'turn', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'call', 'upon', 'introduction', 'andy', 'erin', 'romance', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'show', 'innocence', 'harken', 'back', 'early', 'jim_pam', 'season', 'due', 'andy', 'total', 'absolute', 'goofiness', 'take', 'forever', 'good', 'way', 'thing', 'really', 'get', 'ground', 'two', 'thing', 'get', 'little', 'annoying', 'continued', 'dwight', 'angela', 'battle', 'never', 'seem', 'end', 'bates', 'new', 'character', 'seem', 'add', 'much', 'comedy', 'show', 'whatsoever', 'despite', 'fact', 'episode', 'bit', 'uneven', 'term', 'overall', 'quality', 'hilarity', 'drop', 'season', 'five', 'star', 'due', 'extraordinary', 'content', 'really', 'good_episode', 'basically', 'season', 'start', 'bit', 'slow', 'hit', 'stride', 'jim_pam', 'wedding', 'level', 'baby', 'episode', 'limp', 'finish', 'line', 'also', 'final', 'scene', 'hint', 'possible', 'return', 'fan', 'favorite', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'rejuvenate', 'proceeding', 'seventh', 'season', 'next', 'fall']"

He's doesn't have the tics that make even the most peripheral Office characters seem funny and real. His purpose is to fill a 1-dimensional role of a smarmy, jerky guy. Boring.

And even that Michael's favorite character is Artie, played by Kevin McHale, who was the pizza delivery boy in S4. Great connection there.What stops the episode dead in its tracks, as with every episode, is Pam's baby drama. I don't watch a show called 'The Office' to hear babies crying. That is, in fact, the very last thing I'd want to hear on any show.Pam and Jim were cute in the first three seasons. Now they're simply tedious co-dependents with no character. They exist as each other's halves and are no longer independent entities. It's beyond gross.Dwight is, as ever, the highlight of the episode. Not just because he finally shuts the damn baby up, but I thoroughly enjoy his contractual relationship with Angela. Imo, Dwight comes across as someone with asperger's or high-functioning autism. Emotions like love are difficult for him. I can 100% believe his relationship being one of pure logic... at least, in his mind.I enjoyed Andy's screw-up just as much as I enjoyed Dwight manipulating Jim. That said, I don't understand Andy's simping for Erin. The storyline is like an attempt at recreating Jim-Pam except, sad to say it, but Erin is a limp noodle by comparison. I don't see how someone as charismatic and immensely talented as Andy would fall for her.Anyway, this was an odd episode overall.

Ryan is a very boring character, and basing an episode on him is never inspiring.

The obstacles to overcome were not interesting enough, plus Stanley's short confessional was blame dumb.The ""B"" story was nothing short of brilliant. So much real-life Scranton history is presented here, and the Angela/Dwight contract is voided after Angela is left waiting and discovers a new love interest.

875,7,10,8.0,i-am-so-original,2 December 2010,"More often than not, at least in these days, The Office has been disappointing fans. The magic of the first three seasons has been lost, but that does not necessarily mean the show still can not be good. Fnans have been hoping week after week for a stellar episode, and after the show's horrible last outing WUPHF.com, Office fans can relax, because this episode is what they are looking for.China started out with a funny cold opening featuring Dwight doing everything with his feet. To prove how ridiculous it is, Jim challenges him to drink a cup of coffee with his feet, resulting in Dwight spilling it all over his shirt. While predictable, it was still pretty amusing and a pleasant return to form for Jim.The A story for this episode, Michael arguing with Oscar over China's politics, was funny, but not the highlight of the episode. It was satisfactory to see Michael outsmart Oscar at first, as I've always found Oscar to be a little snob. But the conclusion of this storyline was great - Michael decides that China is not the important part of their conversation, but the conversation itself. Conversation leads to friendship, and it was nice to see Michael happy for himself for discovering this.Before getting to the superior part of the episode, stating that the mini-storyline between Andy and Darryl was hilarious needs to be said. ""Are you seeing this?"" texts Andy to Darryl, who is standing five feet away from him. While adding nothing to the story, it was fun to see a friendly interaction between the two.The best part of the episode was the B story in which Pam threatens to vacate everyone from the building because of Dwight's ridiculous policies such as saving power and reducing the toilet paper to half a ply. The reason it worked so well was because of all the twists, turns, and heart to be found. The first twist comes from Dwight finding out Pam was lying about the possible future building, and the second came at the end when the audience finds out Dwight deliberately let Pam win the argument. The latter came from a heartbreaking conversation between Pam and Jim in the stairwell; Pam is upset that she has been a failure at everything she's tried. While confessing this to Jim, Dwight overhears her and decides to let her win this one. It was a welcome return to the heart that is found in the early seasons of The Office, and it was heartwearming to see Dwight let Pam win. It's moments like this when we realize Dwight is not such a bad guy after all.There seemed to be a general theme continuing throughout the episode; while the trivial things are sometimes fun to win, the deeper element is the friendship involved.

The comedy is some of the best in the series, and the characters, especially Michael and Holly display such a wide range of emotions. This is one of those episodes where you just can't stop laughing. To the reviewer before me I say that you need to lighten up. All I can think of is Michael's nephew when I read your review. The point of this episode was to celebrate Holly and Michael's love and to build up to their exit from the show. Maybe Holly was so infatuated with Michael she didn't care or forgot about her position and the rules and did it any way. That happens to people. Also Pam and Jim were drunk off their ass. Anything can happen when you're drunk off your ass. It was a good joke to fill in time. The fact that they went through with it doesn't cheapen their relationship at all. It shows they are human and that great couples do stupid stuff, especially when drunk and horny.Also, about your last paragraph: junk happens. People screw up, especially in the business world.

It wasn't that I disliked anything about it, it's just that I had a lot of other shows that I was watching at the time, and then just kinda forgot about it. Well I have binge watched all of the episodes up until now within the last two months, and I'm feeling like I'm a part of Dunder-Mifflin. I'm so happy that Michael has found someone who is just as goofy as he is. Michael Dcott has got to be one of the most interesting characters on tv. He can be such a jacka**, but also has a charm that keeps you rooting for him. One minute you are shaking your head at something he does or says, and another minute you feel bad when he loses (again and again). Jam was about the most abusive person ever, and I'm so happy he's not with her. While Melora Hardin was incredible, Jan Levinson-Gould was the worst. So while I'm so very happy that Michael and Holly are having their ""happily ever after"" (I never understood the ""hate"" for Holly) I'm heartbroken that they are both leaving. The relationship I'm going to miss the most was the one Michael has with Pam. She took care of him and had to protect him from himself so many times. They were a great team. Her stopping him from his original proposal was exactly what I'm going to miss the most.

When Michael said he was going to propose in fire I was laughing like crazy and Jim messes with Dwight, as always these two make a classic combo. This episode has a 5.4 right now on IMDb. But if you click on how it was broken down then you'll see that of the 23 votes, 18 gave it a 10, 1 gave it a 9, and 2 gave it an 8, then there is 2 people who gave it a 1. IMDb has a very good ratings system but it fails on this episode. Break it down and you'll find that this is popular among most voters. But now back to the episode. Like I said it was funny, but it was also touching. The way Michael proposes to Holly is just beautiful, he goes through all of the important moments that hes known her and it is very touching.

Michael is saying goodbye to Dunder-Mifflin with his final Dundies (which I can't help but think that they could have done more Dundie episodes throughout the show).Starting with the positives; this show is hilarious. Dwight on the sound effects keyboard was the my favourite part. The boi-oi-oing after Stanley wins and the crickets chirping after Gabe gets dumped and him dealing it in the most awaken manner possible was insanely funny. Despite the fact that Deangelo wasn't exactly a fan favourite, he still delivers some pretty funny lines. The last five minutes of this episode are incredible in every way; the writing, the directing, and acting culminating to create a sentimental masterpiece. Fun fact: Steve Carrell didn't know that the rest of the cast were going to do that song, so it's really The Office cast saying goodbye to Steve which makes this episode even more heart warming.The only things barring me from rating this episode 10 is; 1) Deangelo does not work in The Office environment despite the aforementioned chemistry between Will and Steve. 2) Dwight is angry with Michael for not recommending to replace him and acts as though he has been a perfect servant to Michael which may be the case for the first couple of seasons. However, after re-watching this show a concerning amount of times, I realise that ever since Andy found out about Angela cheating on him with Dwight, and they broke up, Dwight has become less and less interested in being a good number 2 for Michael.

961,7,21,10.0,dabeluoki,21 April 2020,"This episode ""Goodbye Michael Scott Episode 22 season 7"" is the greatest media I have ever seen, from the great pacing, great comedy, and the emotional but sad ending. I am writing this review April 21 2020, in the eleventh grade with tears in my eyes. For some background the office was a show that had already finished before I had begun to even watch.I started watching this show during the coronavirus wear schools worldwide was shutdown. So it's not like I grew up watching the office or anything I also already knew Michael (The Best Character in the Show) was already leaving. Yet I'm still teary eyed watching this show from his emotional/funny send offs with all the other great characters in a show.From Michael telling Andy and Kevin to believe in themselves (Giving Andy all of his sales jobs even though he is a terrible salesman and telling Kevin not to settle for his stature and keep improv). To giving great advice to Erin, Creed, Meridth, and Gabe helpful advice. From finally Michael trying to not to be an absolute dick to Toby, to giving crappy but funny gifts to Oscar, Ryan, and Stanley. To just telling Angela and Kelly what they want to here. Finally giving Dwight the recommendation for Manager he always wanted and having a heart full conversation with Jim where he tells Michael he was the best manager he ever had.Michal Scott after all his relentless and failures with the woman in his life he finally gets the girl of his dreams Holly and moves to Colorado to who he engaged to, which was also an amazing proposal too.When he leaves the office, Pam just gets there and it was a very telling scene when run scurries to the airport to say her goodbyes before he leaves. Despite all the trouble Michael causes for these characters many of them (like Pam) truly love him. I couldn't ask for a greater episode, Thank you Michael Scott For all the great laughs and I look forward to finishing your show.",27/29,episode goodbye michael_scott episode season great medium ever see great pacing great comedy emotional sad ending write review april 0000 eleventh grade tear eye background office show already finish begin even watch start watch show coronavirus wear school worldwide shutdown like grow watch office anything also already know michael best character show already leave yet still teary eyed watch show emotional funny send great character show michael tell andy kevin believe give andy sale job even_though terrible salesman tell kevin settle stature keep improv give great advice erin creed meridth gabe helpful advice finally michael try absolute dick toby give crappy funny gift oscar ryan stanley tell angela kelly want finally give dwight recommendation manager always want heart full conversation jim tell michael good manager ever michal scott relentless failure woman life finally get girl dream holly move colorado engage also amazing proposal leave office pam get telling scene run scurry airport say goodbye leave despite trouble michael cause character many like pam truly love could ask great episode thank michael_scott great laugh look_forward finish show,"['episode', 'goodbye', 'michael_scott', 'episode', 'season', 'great', 'medium', 'ever', 'see', 'great', 'pacing', 'great', 'comedy', 'emotional', 'sad', 'ending', 'write', 'review', 'april', '0000', 'eleventh', 'grade', 'tear', 'eye', 'background', 'office', 'show', 'already', 'finish', 'begin', 'even', 'watch', 'start', 'watch', 'show', 'coronavirus', 'wear', 'school', 'worldwide', 'shutdown', 'like', 'grow', 'watch', 'office', 'anything', 'also', 'already', 'know', 'michael', 'best', 'character', 'show', 'already', 'leave', 'yet', 'still', 'teary', 'eyed', 'watch', 'show', 'emotional', 'funny', 'send', 'great', 'character', 'show', 'michael', 'tell', 'andy', 'kevin', 'believe', 'give', 'andy', 'sale', 'job', 'even_though', 'terrible', 'salesman', 'tell', 'kevin', 'settle', 'stature', 'keep', 'improv', 'give', 'great', 'advice', 'erin', 'creed', 'meridth', 'gabe', 'helpful', 'advice', 'finally', 'michael', 'try', 'absolute', 'dick', 'toby', 'give', 'crappy', 'funny', 'gift', 'oscar', 'ryan', 'stanley', 'tell', 'angela', 'kelly', 'want', 'finally', 'give', 'dwight', 'recommendation', 'manager', 'always', 'want', 'heart', 'full', 'conversation', 'jim', 'tell', 'michael', 'good', 'manager', 'ever', 'michal', 'scott', 'relentless', 'failure', 'woman', 'life', 'finally', 'get', 'girl', 'dream', 'holly', 'move', 'colorado', 'engage', 'also', 'amazing', 'proposal', 'leave', 'office', 'pam', 'get', 'telling', 'scene', 'run', 'scurry', 'airport', 'say', 'goodbye', 'leave', 'despite', 'trouble', 'michael', 'cause', 'character', 'many', 'like', 'pam', 'truly', 'love', 'could', 'ask', 'great', 'episode', 'thank', 'michael_scott', 'great', 'laugh', 'look_forward', 'finish', 'show']"
962,7,21,10.0,franciscoraposo72,26 April 2012,"Let me tell you why, The Office is my favorite TV show, mostly because of Carell, and now, watching an episode where he leaves was just really... I don't know, first of all, I'm pretty sad that Steve left the cast, but, he was the one who wanted that, he's career is growing fast and he did good leaving, but not entirely, thousands of fans-including me-got really sad. Goodbye, Michael was a great episode and a great farewell to Steve, it still had its awesome humor but it also had the heartwarming moments and the sad moments. If you could see me watching this episode, you'd see a tear-eyed (Or probably really crying) for sometimes and sometimes you'd see a guy laughing in a nostalgic way that makes you sad but still satisfied. Bye Michael Scott/ Michael Scarn/ Michael Klump, etc. If you loved the show and you've watched all the episodes like I did and you laughed, you were heart warmed and all of that mostly by Steve, than prepare, cause this episode will test your limits, I'm not really guy that usually cries, but I couldn't help it, Goodbye, Michael is an episode that I'll never forget, I cried, I laughed, I was ""nostalged"" and think this was a perfect way for Michael to leave The Office. The show will never be the same, but well, it was terrific to watch these last 7 seasons and 21 episodes. This episode was heartwarming and sad when we saw Michael and it was funny when we saw DeAngelo (Ferrell) and obviously, Michael as well.To Michael Scott: Michael Scott (Steve), I'll never forget you, your're a crazy boss and you picked the right woman and now I hope you're happy at Colorado, you provided us big laughs and tears and by the way, that thing that fits you better is your mug, that describes exactly what you are, ""World's Best Boss"".Jim Halpert: Best boss I ever had.One of the best episodes of the entire show, I loved it and now, to finish the review:I'll miss you Michael.",103/106,"let tell office favorite show mostly carell watch episode leave really know first pretty sad steve leave cast one want career grow fast good leaving entirely thousand fan include get really sad goodbye michael great episode great farewell steve still awesome humor also heartwarme moment sad moment could see watch episode see tear eyed probably really cry sometimes sometimes see guy laugh nostalgic way make sad still satisfied bye michael_scott/ michael scarn/ michael klump etc love show watch episode like laugh heart warm mostly steve prepare cause episode test limit really guy usually cry could help goodbye michael episode never forget cry laugh nostalged think perfect way michael leave office show never well terrific watch last season episode episode heartwarming sad see michael funny see deangelo ferrell obviously michael well michael_scott michael_scott steve never forget your're crazy boss pick right woman hope happy colorado provide big laugh tear way thing fit well mug describe exactly world good boss"" jim halpert good boss ever one good_episode entire show love finish review i'll miss michael","['let', 'tell', 'office', 'favorite', 'show', 'mostly', 'carell', 'watch', 'episode', 'leave', 'really', 'know', 'first', 'pretty', 'sad', 'steve', 'leave', 'cast', 'one', 'want', 'career', 'grow', 'fast', 'good', 'leaving', 'entirely', 'thousand', 'fan', 'include', 'get', 'really', 'sad', 'goodbye', 'michael', 'great', 'episode', 'great', 'farewell', 'steve', 'still', 'awesome', 'humor', 'also', 'heartwarme', 'moment', 'sad', 'moment', 'could', 'see', 'watch', 'episode', 'see', 'tear', 'eyed', 'probably', 'really', 'cry', 'sometimes', 'sometimes', 'see', 'guy', 'laugh', 'nostalgic', 'way', 'make', 'sad', 'still', 'satisfied', 'bye', 'michael_scott/', 'michael', 'scarn/', 'michael', 'klump', 'etc', 'love', 'show', 'watch', 'episode', 'like', 'laugh', 'heart', 'warm', 'mostly', 'steve', 'prepare', 'cause', 'episode', 'test', 'limit', 'really', 'guy', 'usually', 'cry', 'could', 'help', 'goodbye', 'michael', 'episode', 'never', 'forget', 'cry', 'laugh', 'nostalged', 'think', 'perfect', 'way', 'michael', 'leave', 'office', 'show', 'never', 'well', 'terrific', 'watch', 'last', 'season', 'episode', 'episode', 'heartwarming', 'sad', 'see', 'michael', 'funny', 'see', 'deangelo', 'ferrell', 'obviously', 'michael', 'well', 'michael_scott', 'michael_scott', 'steve', 'never', 'forget', ""your're"", 'crazy', 'boss', 'pick', 'right', 'woman', 'hope', 'happy', 'colorado', 'provide', 'big', 'laugh', 'tear', 'way', 'thing', 'fit', 'well', 'mug', 'describe', 'exactly', 'world', 'good', 'boss', '""', 'jim', 'halpert', 'good', 'boss', 'ever', 'one', 'good_episode', 'entire', 'show', 'love', 'finish', 'review', 'i', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'michael']"

But it has its funny moments too. One of my favorite scenes, and maybe one of my favorite scenes from the entire show, is when Michael gives the homemade scarecrow to Oscar and then in his office he starts laughing hysterically because he knows Oscar has the lowest opinion of him. I love that scene because it shows how much Michael has matured, and also because Steve's laugh is so infectious! But then there's the part where he says goodbye to the warehouse employees over and over until he makes the backwards basketball shot. Still something that silly Michael would do! The whole episode is amazing, I love how he has a special goodbye for everyone like paintball with Dwight and ""lunch"" with Jim. The writers did an amazing job with this episode, they couldn't have had a more perfect ending to the character of Michael. As much as I love this episode, I always hate when I get to it because I know Michael is leaving! The show isn't the same without him after this episode, but I still love the whole show so much.

974,7,21,10.0,BertMacklin_9,28 April 2011,"This is probably the best episode of the season yet. Compared to the other seasons, this one has been just alright. It hasn't hit me on a very funny, smart, or emotional level. Its still good though, and I have seen every episode of this great show. Well either way, I thought this was such a smart and different send-off. It was really something you wouldn't expect from a comedy show, or even a drama, or any show in that case.The main premise of the show was focusing on Michael. He printed out a list of everyone who worked in the office with him, and wanted to say goodbye to them in special ways. These moments were very touching, and even funny, especially with Oscar. And it also showed that Michael was not ready to cause any drama. Especially when he wants to say goodbye to Kelly, and she's on her phone and ignoring him, then he leaves. That was pretty much how his character was today, very calm, very quiet. This episode also had some very smart ideas to it. I enjoyed the interview with Dwight, him reading Michael's letter, being very sarcastic because he is mad at him, then the camera zooms in on him. Then when him and Michael play paintball, and how the camera sits far away, as we see two close friends have fun for one last time together. Another great scene which blew me away in such a small way was when Kevin, Jim, and Pam are eating in the breakroom, and Michael is in there also, and as the three blabber away, the camera zooms in on Michael, realizing that he is truly going to miss these people. Another great subtle part was when Michael, just as he's about to leave, looks at everyone working and going about in the office. The camera just sat there for a couple seconds. And lastly, that final ending. The whole time, I was really hoping that Pam and him would catch up, and I literally almost cried when he leaves, and then Pam arrives at the office right as he left. But that airport sequence was genius. Another great technique was how it cut out the sound at the part. When Michael is about to board his plane to Colorado, he says ""finally get to get this off my chest,"" referring to the microphone, then the sound becomes less clear, but you hear him murmur his last ""that's what she said"" joke. Then the camera stays, as you see him walking towards the plain, about to board it then Pam comes running out to say goodbye. It caught me so off guard, but it was so great. You see them saying goodbye, but you can't exactly hear what they're saying. Such a great part. It reminded me of the end of ""lost in translation"" so much. Then that final shot, where the camera is behind Pam's side, and you see her, looking up at Michael's plane, as he leaves for a new life.This show was superb. Very emotional and smart, and yet very subtle. I liked that it chose not to make a huge deal of Michael's departure in the plot. It took a more quiet turn, and it showed Michael's transformation as a person. In pretty much seasons 1 - 6, he would be making a huge deal out of him leaving, or anyone leaving in that case (""Goodbye Toby"" season 4 finale). But Steve Carrell really pulled it off here. He showed that his character, on the outside, is somewhat a pathetic goofball that needs to be liked and is very crude and obnoxious, but at heart, Carrell showed that all along, Michael Scott was a man looking for a stable life, with a nice wife, and ""100's of children so that they can all be his friends.""

I have been an ardent, dedicated Office devotee for seven years - not overly either, but when I watched this episode things happened that made my sides hurt and eyes tear.

His uncle sends him a holster and he wears the gun in the office only to accidentally shoot the gun off. Jo - Kathy Bates's character is on her way to see how he is doing as acting manager. Dwight calls a meeting where he tries to open with a gun safety meeting in which Rainn Wilson does a fantastic job only to be out-done later with his ""jazz"" hands bit. The staff in the office basically blackmail Dwight into a variety of things. Jim clearly comes up with the best as every time he coughs Dwight is to use ""jazz"" hands. He coughs while Bates is there and that moment stirred such laughter in me with Jim's request, his subsequent cough, and Dwight's bizarre, comedic use of his hands. The moment for me is the highlight but is backed with a further hilarious incident with Kevin and Dwight scratching his back and, the piece de resistance is Creed becoming the acting manager at the end of the episode.

986,7,24,,bob the moo,29 May 2011,"Many years ago The Office US tried to copy the UK original and it was a mess. Fortunately this approach was ditched for the second season and a much warmer but just as funny sitcom came out of it and I have enjoyed it for many seasons now – even though it has gotten more ""traditional"" as it has gone along. Season 7 is to be Michael Scott's final season and I knew this going in. From the very start there are some things that made me think that perhaps this would be a good time to wrap it up even though I know the makers are forging ahead to continue the show without Carell. The most obvious of these is that in many episodes the writing is just not as good as previous seasons.Well, not the writing in terms of dialogue but the structure, the ideas, the ""things"" that happen each episode from the pre-credit sequence through to the actual plot of that episode. So we have plots involving herpes, Andy's play, counselling and a few other things that don't work quite as well as similar plots in previous seasons. They do still work though because in essence the jokes/plots are the same in terms of what they are trying to do and there are the usual interoffice rivalries, horseplay, relationships and characters. Some of this is forced (for example a cameo by Olyphant appears only to be there as a lot device that doesn't really go anywhere meaningful) but it is still funny. The cast of characters in the office make this the case as all of them can be relied upon to give a hilarious aside when called upon and this is frequently but the season is really at its strongest when it is mixing this up while also focusing on Scott. This extends the approach taken in seasons 5 and 6 where the show became more and more character driven and less about well-observed things happening in the workplace.This still works because Scott is such a great character. An embarrassing clown on the outside but really just missing something on the inside. Bringing Holly back into the story was a great move because she seems to get him but also helps him reign it in a little bit too and see what is important. These episodes are the best of the season because they have him at the core and are funny as well as meaningful for his character. Jim and Pam as the ""relationship driver"" of the show seems to have run its course and there are plenty of other characters who start having personal lives which can be used by the writers – not all of them work as well and some of the characters are best left as comedy asides, but there is room to grow here if done well. This is shown by the decision to get Scott out a few episodes from the end, to let the show justify moving forward to season 8. These episodes are funny and make good use of the cast, albeit they are helped ""event"" wise by being about the management gap left by him leaving – which helps covers up the early-season weaknesses of some of the events/plots not being that great. These events and threads will be key to keeping it going – if season 8 is engaging and funny without being silly or forced then Scott can be moved past – if not then that character will simply hover over the show as a ghost of better times.Even if the show does keep on without him for many more seasons, Carell is still great and the best character on the show because he is a mix of comedy and tragic that works very well. His performance is convincing and he has really made Scott more than just a comedy character. Wilson continues to be very funny and the material is there for his delivery. Krasinski is left with a few too many ""looks to camera"" this season as the plots move away from him and Pam – he is good at them, but he needs the material to prevent him doing it too often. Fischer remains such a sweet performance and so grounded that it is hard not to love her – and I do. It is really hard to separate the supporting cast because all of them are really good when called upon for parts. From the dumb Baumgartner to tragic sad-eyed Lieberstein to the bubble-headed Kaling to the erratic Bratton, everyone gets their characters just right and are rewarded with consistently strong asides and lines from the writers.Season 7 of The US Office and it is still in good health. The loss of Carell is a reason to have worries over the future of the show but without him I think it has more than enough talent in cast and writers to carry on. The plots are key to it doing so, as some of the weaker ones in this season produced weaker episodes but conversely season 7 also has some nice threads that provide a good base for asides and laughs. When compared against seasons 2-6, season 7 could have been better in many regards but it is still entertaining and funny – now the challenge will be keeping it going now the obvious focal point has been removed.",19/36,many year ago office try copy original mess fortunately approach ditch second season much warm funny sitcom come enjoy many season even_though get traditional along season

988,7,24,5.0,zkonedog,5 July 2019,"With the exception of potentially Family Guy, I consider ""The Office"" to be the greatest television comedy ever produced. Sadly, all good things must come to an end--eventually--and this seventh season emphasizes that quote more than any of the previous six efforts.Here's the problem(s) with Season Seven: I've always believed that the entire series hinges on three characters--Jim, Pam, and Michael Scott. Jim & Pam form the dramatic/emotional backbone of the show, while Michael is the comedic ""glue"" that holds everything together. The other characters wax and wane depending on the episode, but that ""Big Three"" more than likely decides the course of the show. Unfortunately, none of those three character arcs were anywhere near the top of their game this season.In terms of Jim/Pam, they really carried the Sixth Season (with the wedding and baby episodes) and take a bit of a back seat here in favor of Daryl, Andy, Erin, & Gabe. While providing a few moments of chuckling humor and emotion, by and large the dramatic side of the show was nonexistent.With Michael, it was more a case of Steve Carrell knowing this would be his final season. Thus, it seemed as if the writers didn't (or couldn't) commit to any sort of meaningful character arc for him. The first half of the season he kind of just bops around aimlessly in his back-and-forth with Holly, while the second half is devoted to feeling out his potential replacements.The one good thing I can say about this season, though, is that--as always--the writers ALWAYS deliver a rock-solid episode when it is absolutely needed. Much like the Jim/Pam wedding/baby episodes saved last season, the final 2-3 episodes featuring Michael Scott are the only thing keeping my rating from plunging to a measly one star. In fact, Michael's swan song is perhaps the best single episode in show history (or at least in the running).Thus, though I know I will still be tuning in for Season Eight on NBC next fall, the reasonable part of me says I should probably give up the ghost right now, as I see no way for the show to ever regain the comedic/dramatic gold standard it once held. With Michael Scott gone and Jim/Pam potentially played out, only a miracle from the writers will keep this show watchable. Not saying it can't be done, but I think the odds are large against it.",15/47,exception potentially family guy consider office great television comedy ever produce sadly good thing must come end eventually seventh season emphasize quote previous six effort problem(s season seven always believe entire series hinge three character jim_pam michael_scott jim_pam form dramatic emotional backbone show michael comedic glue hold everything together character wax wane depend episode big three likely decide course show unfortunately none three character arc anywhere near top game season term jim_pam really carry sixth season wedding baby episode take bit back seat favor daryl andy erin gabe provide moment chuckle humor emotion large dramatic side show nonexistent michael case steve_carrell know would final season thus seem writer could commit sort meaningful character arc first half season kind bop around aimlessly back forth holly second half devoted feel potential replacement one good thing say season though always writer always deliver rock solid episode absolutely need much like jim_pam wedding baby episode save last season final episode feature michael_scott thing keep rating plunge measly one star fact michael swan song perhaps good single episode show history least running).thus though know still tune season eight nbc next fall reasonable part say probably give ghost right see way show ever regain comedic dramatic gold standard hold michael_scott jim_pam potentially play miracle writer keep show watchable say think odd large,"['exception', 'potentially', 'family', 'guy', 'consider', 'office', 'great', 'television', 'comedy', 'ever', 'produce', 'sadly', 'good', 'thing', 'must', 'come', 'end', 'eventually', 'seventh', 'season', 'emphasize', 'quote', 'previous', 'six', 'effort', 'problem(s', 'season', 'seven', 'always', 'believe', 'entire', 'series', 'hinge', 'three', 'character', 'jim_pam', 'michael_scott', 'jim_pam', 'form', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'backbone', 'show', 'michael', 'comedic', 'glue', 'hold', 'everything', 'together', 'character', 'wax', 'wane', 'depend', 'episode', 'big', 'three', 'likely', 'decide', 'course', 'show', 'unfortunately', 'none', 'three', 'character', 'arc', 'anywhere', 'near', 'top', 'game', 'season', 'term', 'jim_pam', 'really', 'carry', 'sixth', 'season', 'wedding', 'baby', 'episode', 'take', 'bit', 'back', 'seat', 'favor', 'daryl', 'andy', 'erin', 'gabe', 'provide', 'moment', 'chuckle', 'humor', 'emotion', 'large', 'dramatic', 'side', 'show', 'nonexistent', 'michael', 'case', 'steve_carrell', 'know', 'would', 'final', 'season', 'thus', 'seem', 'writer', 'could', 'commit', 'sort', 'meaningful', 'character', 'arc', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'kind', 'bop', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'back', 'forth', 'holly', 'second', 'half', 'devoted', 'feel', 'potential', 'replacement', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'say', 'season', 'though', 'always', 'writer', 'always', 'deliver', 'rock', 'solid', 'episode', 'absolutely', 'need', 'much', 'like', 'jim_pam', 'wedding', 'baby', 'episode', 'save', 'last', 'season', 'final', 'episode', 'feature', 'michael_scott', 'thing', 'keep', 'rating', 'plunge', 'measly', 'one', 'star', 'fact', 'michael', 'swan', 'song', 'perhaps', 'good', 'single', 'episode', 'show', 'history', 'least', 'running).thus', 'though', 'know', 'still', 'tune', 'season', 'eight', 'nbc', 'next', 'fall', 'reasonable', 'part', 'say', 'probably', 'give', 'ghost', 'right', 'see', 'way', 'show', 'ever', 'regain', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'gold', 'standard', 'hold', 'michael_scott', 'jim_pam', 'potentially', 'play', 'miracle', 'writer', 'keep', 'show', 'watchable', 'say', 'think', 'odd', 'large']"

Glad to see that The Office has returned to believable plots (or at least partially believable). A far cry from the over the top 'The Hangover' style slapstick mess that we've been seeing recently. The producers really need to stay away from turning the show into a teenage-movie comedy / sitcom.Erin's silliness, although charming, sometimes spoils the atmosphere of the show. I have also noticed that Oscar has gone slightly goofy this season. It would be much more enjoyable to watch if there were more naive characters (like the old Pam). I am still looking forward to the moment that The Office will fully recover from the lowbrow humour that we've seen recently. I miss the awkward reactions from Season 1, 2, and 3. E.g. the characters looking at the camera when they are uncomfortable or when someone does something unprofessional etc. Currently, the employees appear to readily accept inappropriate behaviour in the office, and the whole show feels like a sitcom. We need more head shaking, eye rolling and walking away from Angela. We need to see some characters telling Andy that they need to get on with their work. Make it believable! Just my suggestion on how the The Office could go about if its still wants to claim itself as a mockumentary.Overall it is a step in the right direction.

1031,8,6,3.0,wafehling-79289,9 March 2015,"Most episodes of The Office can manage to push past plot holes and feasibility issues, or even embrace them, with a few exceptions. (I'm looking at you, Fire Drill.) But this episode simply makes me want to scream. The entire plot revolves around a device that will literally get everyone fired if it goes off at 5 PM, including Dwight, who created it. This device is apparently on the server in the office, which as far as I can tell, is in the closet/Ryan's office, but is definitely in the building somewhere. They set the device off, everyone panics, and the entire episode is about trying to deal with a Dwight that feels like he was written as a heavily unstable and illogical psychopath, and not his strange, rigid, but ultimately human self.The plot holes in this are cannonballs shot through a barn roof. 1. Unplug the server. It's right there. Pull the plug at 4:59, no more problems. UNPLUG IT! This is literally a time bomb plugged into a wall circuit, and the writers just made everyone laughably stupid enough to not consider unplugging the godforsaken thing. This alone utterly breaks the episode. 2. Dwight is killing any chance he has for advancement at the company, which he's spent the entire 8-season running frothing over trying to get. From the devotion and intense loyalty towards the company he's shown since S1E1, this is literally the equivalent of Dwight shooting himself in the foot. Utterly illogical behavior. Really consistent mindset there, writers. 3. Andy is the manager, ranks above Dwight, and has authority. Dwight has to give up the code. There's not a single company in the world who would let a subordinate hijack the computer system and refuse to give up control when asked by a superior. Andy folds like he's powerless, for NO REASON AT ALL. He literally never even tries to use his power to persuade him, because at that point most viewers would go ""Oh hey, that doesn't make any sense,"" and the entire plot would fall apart even more than it already has. I know Andy's not a bastion of confidence, but come on! Everyone is going to be fired! He's not a sentient noodle!The side plots of this episode are rather buried, but not poorly-written or unreasonable, so this doesn't get a 1, but wow.

I actually found a Wikipedia page pointing out how the character Michael Scott displays many traits of someone severely mentally challenged. The Office is still so lovable; despite all of it's dysfunction.I had to look up who those musicians were in this episode and found out that James Spader plays a mean harmonica. I like to play harmonica (see my YouTube videos) and know how difficult it is. James Spader plays Midnight Rambler as good as Mick Jager himself. Amazing. The rest of the players are industry types like the ones that wrote all the music for The Partridge Family. Where would we be without them?Dwight commits what could be construed as a sex offence groping Jim; as a bazaar arousal test. I do not think it should be considered a sex offence since both males are heterosexual. There is no way to talk your way out of any sex offence in our insensitive, upside down court system; these days and I am sure people have been charged for less. There are more sex offences in movies and television than can be counted; then we wonder why that is a problem. As far as exposing yourself The Office takes the cake though. Still; The Office is such a Amazingly entertaining show and a great series to watch so I guess we will have to forgive them.

All the amazing interactions; Michael and Dwight, Dwight and Jim, Michael with the rest of the cast, etc. Ever since Mr Scott left the building, it has been painful to watch, and this episode was a new low. Andy is not Michael. He simply does not get away with all the absurd remarks and situations he gets himself into. Furthermore, the characters are stuck. Jim and Pam used to be fun to follow, but after the wedding and Michael's departure they started getting boring.

It's obviously next to impossible to continue producing episodes at such a high quality without Steve Carrell, but up until the previous episode ""Gettysburg"", the writing has been - off, to say the least. ""Mrs. California"" was a strong writing performance by Greg Daniels, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Jim was Jim again, with his dry wit and sheepishness. The opening was refreshing, to see Dwight in another of his obscure fixations- this time with the benefits of standing over sitting and thus becoming the victim of a decent Jim prank. Maura Tierney? Can anyone say ""guest star of the year""? Not even for her performance, just because I've missed her on the sitcom swing since NewsRadio. She played the wife of CEO Robert California (James Spader) hopeful for employment at Dunder-Mifflin. Spader was hilarious, sending extremely mixed messages on whether or not Andy should hire his wife. Dwight's opening of a gym was also a nice touch, my favorite line of the episode coming after Dwight tells Darryl he plans to make him look like LeBron James ""it's LeJon Brames."" ""That's what I said..."". Craig Robinson is a great actor, and I'm not sure if Darryl wants to leave Dunder-Mifflin or if the actor wants to leave the show.

The show passed from being a mainstream fake documentary to a modern commercial sitcom. The documentary idea was thrown to the trash can.Although this episode was awesome, from the beginning until the end. And this is because they took each characters personality and squeezed them with fantastic monologues; and the key is there: you need external issues for making the show work.The Catherine Tate character is a great addition (in my opinion better than Robert California) because is female, strong and mysterious. There had been a really long time since Ryan was so funny. Dwight is great as always. Jim isn't a prankster anymore, but, still he is the normal guy in hilarious situations. I don't think any character from other office seasons should had been the boss, but Andy is and in this episode isn't bothering to watch as in the last ones. The cool Stanley is awesome.

The things is, i don't think everything else is bad at all, but just with the presence of Nellie it just completely disconnects me from everything else going on.Andy is a great character and i really like his relationship with Erin, and in order to make it work i believe season 8 is completely necessary because Andy needs to grow as a person, realizing what's in front of him and letting go of trying to be liked and accepted by his dad thus realizing that. Otherwise it would like the actress of Erin said, it would be like if Erin was going to take care of Andy. So, maybe going through all of this was necessary for his character, where he needs to learn to have control over his life and standing up against those who are hurting him. All of this would have been really great if it wasn't for Nellie. They couldn't have brought a worse character that would serve to make Andy grow as a character. This season, though suffering from the departure of Michael and a clear lack of creativity from the writers in my opinion, the show was holding itself decently. The episodes in Tallahasse, before having Nellie as the manager were pretty great, and well, while there were a few episodes that are definitely lower in quality than what we came to expect from this show, it wasn't bad.

1140,8,21,3.0,sofiiskikomar,26 April 2020,"Every single persona in this episode is acting out of character and as a mindless dummy. Character development and established qualities are traded of for silly attempts to make the audience laugh. Reality check, people acting dumb is not comedy, it's ridiculousness. This episode mocks everything that made The Office popular in the first place (witty humour and likeable characters). Nellie Bertram is without a doubt the worse thing that has happened to the series. It's so obvious that the creators are trying to recreate Michael Scott and I think It's very insulting to Steve Carrell's phenomenal performance and legendary character. Instead they should've tried something fresh. And as a matter of fact they did, for a time. Robert Califonia's presence is very well felt and entertaining in most scenes, but in this episode he's acting like a total fool. Kelly picking Ryan over Mary Sue is presented with no rational decision and made only to have some cheap laughs. Andy breaking the wall is clear spit in the face of his character development. It is common agreement that Ed Helms' character was unbearable in the early seasons, but the creators did a 180 on him. Often his absence as part of anger management is viewed as his cathartic recreation of the character. Now he breaks a wall again, for no reason what so ever, except - cheap laughs. The press conference meeting talking about erectile dysfunction was more cringy than funny.
We all know that The Office was declining in quality after Steve Carrell's departure. And that is normal, he played vital part to the show's success.

And since his previous co- workers are so worried about him and his mental health, they decide to keep telling him he's awesome, that everything is OK and generally just pampering him. It's annoying. He's not a good character, he's annoying, just kick him off and forget about him.Andy's jokes felt forced and plain unfunny, especially when interacting with Robert California, his ""subtle"" jabs at Robert with his ""rock opera"" even get called out as lame by other characters - yet instead of stopping with that stuff, it remains in the episode and serves as one of the ""good things"" to focus on.The only characters who felt grounded and realistic were Robert and Kevin (which is very unusual since they've been making him into a retard for the past few seasons).Not to forget, the side-plot with Angela's senator gay husband is still going on and brings perhaps a few laughs when Oscar discusses the situation with Jim and Pam.

I think most fans will agree that this episode wasn't too bad, and suddenly at the end it gives a glimmer of hope that they might actually find some solid footing for this series to continue on. I found most of this episode amusing and actually laughed out loud once or twice. There is a funny chase scene with Dwight and Jim versus a salesman from a different office, and Pam and Nellie have a bit of bonding. What this episode did most, though, was to bring us back to a realistic basis for the show. For me, the humor of this season didn't hold up too well, because we had moved the Office into a goofball alternative universe, Robert California style. But in the closing moments of this episode, when we lose all sympathy for Robert, they suddenly open the door to a much more plausible future. During this season this series has repeatedly tried to jump the shark; suddenly, against all odds, they look like they might rally and bring it back. At least for a couple of decent seasons.

1153,8,24,,bob the moo,23 June 2012,"Once The Office US got its own voice it quickly became really enjoyable indeed; the first season was a mistaken attempt to simply repeat the UK original but the second season saw it hit its mark and become its own beast. Later seasons saw it become more of a regular sitcom but it retained enough of its comedic strengths to stay funny. The eighth season manages to keep some of the comedy and the overall approach of asides and smart dialogue but unfortunately it mostly does it within the frame of plots that don't live up to the standard we have come to expect.Ironically the problem with the majority of them is that the plots are often trying so hard to be classic Office that they end up repeating old plots and character arches whether they work or not. It doesn't start out this way though and indeed Robert California adds a wonderfully enjoyable new element to the show that maybe could have been used as a fresh core to the show. Unfortunately, although he is kept and remains good value, he is moved to one side to install Andy as the manager and essentially make him into a Michael Scott character. Once this is done we get a whirlwind tour through the previous seasons in regards repeating Scott's story through Andy; the winning over of staff, the being a jerk but yet also a decent guy, the dealing with corporate threats to the office, the challenges of a competing manager, branching out on his own, acting impulsively in the name of love, and so on. Not all of it is bad but for sure it is hard to escape that fact that the writers are not dealing well with the exit of Michael and have instead just decided to recreate him and try and keep going the way things were.It isn't just this core character though, there are lots of retreads – but sadly a lot of them are clumsy or exaggerated to try and generate energy to add freshness. There are many examples of this; Dwight and Angela again, Ryan and Kelly again are two straight repeats, but more telling is the attempts to repeat plot structures with new characters. So, I liked the ""wouldn't they be good together"" flirting of Darryl and the unavailable Val, but it still felt like a plot thread written because the show knows that office romances have been good material before – so they try to force this one rather than letting it happen. The nature of the supporting characters means there are plenty of options for asides and comedy and often the show is still very funny, but the side-characters are perhaps a bit too pushed to be bigger and noisier than before and not all of the material is as good for them as it was in the past.In terms of additions, Robert California works but Nellie Bertram simply does not. OK she is the exaggerated randomness that the show often loves, but with it she is unlikable, grating and tends to be annoying random rather than fun random. Tate is an acquired taste and I must confess it is not one I often seem to have – I have liked her in some things but here she simply doesn't work as a character or in terms of material, so her performance may be dedicated to delivery, but it is still a delivery of a weak product. The other cast members are better but often struggle with the material as well because, although they are doing good work, there is an air of them doing it with weaker material and when they have in the cast. There is also a sense that they are being asked to do more than their characters are suited to considering that this is a show that was best when the support cast were sparingly and well used.The eighth season of this show is still quite funny and it has enough energy to it to carry it through its problems – but there are problems. The loss of the central character offered the chance for freshness but instead everyone is moved to fill his gap whether they fit or not The material mostly feels recycled with new characters or repeated versions of what has gone before. The dialogue and the performances continue to be good but the overall writing and plotting is weaker and if the ninth season continues the direction of this season then it probably doesn't have too much life left in it.",21/32,office get voice quickly become really enjoyable indeed first season mistaken attempt simply repeat original second season see hit mark become beast later season see

1155,8,24,1.0,zkonedog,5 July 2019,"For five (arguably six) seasons, ""The Office"" combined humor with emotion to produce some of the greatest television ever seen over the airwaves. Then, a transition season (seeing the departure of Steve Carrell) left the show with a very unstable future. Sadly, the ""circle down the drain"" only continues with this eighth season, producing no redeeming moments whatsoever.This season was lost right from the get-go and never improved one iota. The additions of James Spader & Catherine Tate to the cast proved to add nothing to the ""Michael Scott void"", while all the other characters begin to really get stale for the first time in the show's now-lengthy run. Some of the ""lowlights"" of this season (minor spoilers ahead) include...-The complete ruination of the Andy Bernard character and his relationship with Erin. This was supposed to be the next ""Jim & Pam"" kind of relationship, but it has failed miserably. The ""Nard Dog"" was once the funniest character on the show. Now, he is just a shell of his former self. His character just isn't the ""leading man"" type.-The new additions to the cast also failed to impress and even further muddy the waters of the show's identity. But, what should have been expected after the failed experiment of the Will Ferrell character in the previous season?-The auxiliary characters are now old and stale. Whereas their eclectic comments once seemed to never get old, now they are almost cringe-worthy most of the time.The sad fact of the matter is that Michael Scott was the glue that held ""The Office"" together. With his departure, everything has completely melted down. I can honestly say that not a single episode of the entire season stood out as ""funny"". Only Rainn Wilson's Dwight Schrute remains even remotely entertaining (with Jim/Pam now completely played out).I fully expect the show to continue as it is such a big hit for NBC and the network will milk it dry and then some, but I made have to make the tough decision to jump ship before the resolution. I do not take this decision lightly, as I have invested so much in the Dunder Mifflin-ites, but it has now become a chore to watch each week. I saw the same thing happen with ""Smallville"" over on the WB/CW network, and it saddens me to realize ""The Office"", which was once so great, will go out with such a whimper.If you are a casual fan of this show and don't necessarily need to ""see the payoff"" in the end, I would actually encourage you to stop watching after the Michael Scott departure episode towards the end of season seven, which could have (and should have, in hindsight) served as the show finale.

I am grateful for it, at least for Season 8 which wasn't totally a mess because I really had great laughs throughout many episodes and scenes, Robert California and Nellie Bertram were extremely great additions to the show. Although Season 8 doesn't stand above the rest it does the trick.However, this Season premiere episode fell ludicrously flat. Nothing about is funny, nothing happens is interesting, the only scene that made me chuckle is when Dwight wanted to do the calibration-on-rope thing.What went wrong?
It is Andy turning into this giant butt*ole who accepted Nellie just to take revenge from her although he was a total idiot when he left work for his ""romantic endeavor"". Nellie is a great character and she was designed to be hated but many people ended up liking her for her eccentric personality. Yet, they just ruined Andy for us, great.
It is Andy taking it out on Toby for absolutely no reason, no reason at all. Michael Scott hating on Toby had its reasons and it was hilarious because Michael loved many people and hated many people for unknown weirdo reasons. But Andy just hating Toby made no sense.

The actors who play Jim and Dwight just weren't acting that well at all, and I was never interested in the story. I didn't laugh once.

Jim is now basic, not a prankster. Pam is a little mean and boring, not cute, perky, and moral. Andy is now a jerky boss, not an annoying singing sales man with anger bursts. Angela is now a happy normal character, not a tightly wound strict Christian girl who got angry and offended over everything.I miss the pranks and love hate relationship between Jim and Dwight; now they seem to enjoy their company.

1197,9,6,1.0,chris_rowe-881-168820,13 August 2020,"Michael Scott leaving was sad but there was enough to keep thing going easily for another 5-10 seasons, however the casting, writing and editing was so damn lazy and bad that it killed this show. If a semi decent manager was found your telling me this show couldn't have worked? SC was great but not irreplaceable.Firstly the editing was bad, 3 instances spring to mind, the pumpkin visibly had room for dwights head, when Pam taught CT how to drive and said stop when they're already in the bush, then Kevin's thumb visibly pushing the ice cream off, not big deals but the type of sloppy bs that ruined 8/9 to the point it's on par with the scrubs series no one acknowledges.Then the focus on the biggest idiot Andy solely for what? Hangover fame? The guy can't act, as shown in this episode, he is just a cartoon, he has nothing human to offer, same with that moron Kevin, from the voice, to eye movement to tongue out it was almost offensive like mocking special needs.I mean the worst though was the endless screen time give to Ellie kemper even hiring her sister it's just nepotism, she's clearly got a bit of humour and can act but she should be ashamed of her character of Erin, she's written to be pathetic and stupid, from the watermelon teeth, to not going with Andy as he didn't ask(like you wouldn't discuss it) to the obvious set up with the new guy at the end, so the big build of a love story was just two idiotic cartoon characters wasting our time. I can't explain how much her endless OTT mannerisms and swapping from sensible confident talker who is nice but maybe a bit dim, to a complete moron who does and says stupid things that sound wrong, I wanted to slap her through the TV, idiotic character, terribly written and if it seems unnatural a human being like that maybe you should tone it down...I was so glad BJ left, he was abysmal, Mindy should've been a bigger character and stayed, Dwight is the star and actually think CT worked on the floor! Just wasn't management material.This episode barely even made sense, was just forced for more idiotic Andy and Erin time I mean that ginger guy on the boat??? What was he doing! Did he buy it? How dya not know someone escaped from therapy or rehab.. rubbish writing which this show never suffered from, but writing for IDIOT characters equals IDIOTIC plots and episodes.I mean the casting and writing of Erin,Andy,Packer,Ryan,California,Nellie,gabe,mini Dwight and Jim,Kevin are actually awful, there's no real saving graces except the odd line Ryan said was funny, on the whole these characters sucked!!As much as I loved series 1-7 and love Parks and Rec to, it wasn't SC leaving that ended the office it was the lazy writing, terrible casting and just a sense of giving up.Jim's business could introduce some decent new characters. The warehouse could have a bigger part, a rival shop in the building, so many avenues just closed off for the sake of idiocy.How Ed helms and David korchner have careers baffle me, I get Ellie but she's ridiculously annoying and a very acquired taste",7/38,michael_scott leave sad enough keep thing easily another season however casting writing editing damn lazy bad kill show semi decent manager find tell show could work great irreplaceable firstly editing bad instance spring mind pumpkin visibly room dwight head pam teach drive say stop already bush kevin thumb visibly push ice cream big deal type sloppy ruin 0/0 point par scrub series one acknowledge focus big idiot andy solely hangover fame guy act show episode cartoon nothing human offer moron kevin voice eye movement tongue almost offensive like mock special need mean bad though endless screen time give ellie_kemper even hire sister nepotism clearly get bit humour act ashamed character erin write pathetic stupid watermelon tooth andy ask(like would discuss obvious set new guy end big build love story two idiotic cartoon character waste time explain much endless ott mannerism swap sensible confident talker nice maybe bit dim complete moron say stupid thing sound wrong want slap idiotic character terribly write seem unnatural human like maybe tone glad leave abysmal mindy big character stay dwight star actually think work floor management material episode barely even make sense force idiotic andy erin time mean ginger guy boat buy dya know someone escape therapy rehab rubbish writing show never suffer write idiot character equal idiotic plot episode mean casting writing erin andy packer ryan california nellie gabe mini dwight jim kevin actually awful real save grace except odd line ryan say funny whole character sucked!!as much love series love parks rec leave end office lazy writing terrible casting sense give jim business could introduce decent new character warehouse could big part rival shop building many avenue close sake idiocy helms david korchner career baffle get ellie ridiculously annoying acquire taste,"['michael_scott', 'leave', 'sad', 'enough', 'keep', 'thing', 'easily', 'another', 'season', 'however', 'casting', 'writing', 'editing', 'damn', 'lazy', 'bad', 'kill', 'show', 'semi', 'decent', 'manager', 'find', 'tell', 'show', 'could', 'work', 'great', 'irreplaceable', 'firstly', 'editing', 'bad', 'instance', 'spring', 'mind', 'pumpkin', 'visibly', 'room', 'dwight', 'head', 'pam', 'teach', 'drive', 'say', 'stop', 'already', 'bush', 'kevin', 'thumb', 'visibly', 'push', 'ice', 'cream', 'big', 'deal', 'type', 'sloppy', 'ruin', '0/0', 'point', 'par', 'scrub', 'series', 'one', 'acknowledge', 'focus', 'big', 'idiot', 'andy', 'solely', 'hangover', 'fame', 'guy', 'act', 'show', 'episode', 'cartoon', 'nothing', 'human', 'offer', 'moron', 'kevin', 'voice', 'eye', 'movement', 'tongue', 'almost', 'offensive', 'like', 'mock', 'special', 'need', 'mean', 'bad', 'though', 'endless', 'screen', 'time', 'give', 'ellie_kemper', 'even', 'hire', 'sister', 'nepotism', 'clearly', 'get', 'bit', 'humour', 'act', 'ashamed', 'character', 'erin', 'write', 'pathetic', 'stupid', 'watermelon', 'tooth', 'andy', 'ask(like', 'would', 'discuss', 'obvious', 'set', 'new', 'guy', 'end', 'big', 'build', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'idiotic', 'cartoon', 'character', 'waste', 'time', 'explain', 'much', 'endless', 'ott', 'mannerism', 'swap', 'sensible', 'confident', 'talker', 'nice', 'maybe', 'bit', 'dim', 'complete', 'moron', 'say', 'stupid', 'thing', 'sound', 'wrong', 'want', 'slap', 'idiotic', 'character', 'terribly', 'write', 'seem', 'unnatural', 'human', 'like', 'maybe', 'tone', 'glad', 'leave', 'abysmal', 'mindy', 'big', 'character', 'stay', 'dwight', 'star', 'actually', 'think', 'work', 'floor', 'management', 'material', 'episode', 'barely', 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'force', 'idiotic', 'andy', 'erin', 'time', 'mean', 'ginger', 'guy', 'boat', 'buy', 'dya', 'know', 'someone', 'escape', 'therapy', 'rehab', 'rubbish', 'writing', 'show', 'never', 'suffer', 'write', 'idiot', 'character', 'equal', 'idiotic', 'plot', 'episode', 'mean', 'casting', 'writing', 'erin', 'andy', 'packer', 'ryan', 'california', 'nellie', 'gabe', 'mini', 'dwight', 'jim', 'kevin', 'actually', 'awful', 'real', 'save', 'grace', 'except', 'odd', 'line', 'ryan', 'say', 'funny', 'whole', 'character', 'sucked!!as', 'much', 'love', 'series', 'love', 'parks', 'rec', 'leave', 'end', 'office', 'lazy', 'writing', 'terrible', 'casting', 'sense', 'give', 'jim', 'business', 'could', 'introduce', 'decent', 'new', 'character', 'warehouse', 'could', 'big', 'part', 'rival', 'shop', 'building', 'many', 'avenue', 'close', 'sake', 'idiocy', 'helms', 'david', 'korchner', 'career', 'baffle', 'get', 'ellie', 'ridiculously', 'annoying', 'acquire', 'taste']"

1270,9,17,9.0,varghesejunior,16 March 2013,"To be honest with you guys, I have been very disappointed by the way the 9th season of the show.It appeared to me as though the new writers involved were messing with everything that once made the show work. Any went from being a cheerful good hearted guy to a total loser. Jim and Pam who were an example of a match made in heaven to all the young couples out there started having issues that they would've steered clear off in the previous seasons. 16 episodes went by; as I watched this once great show self destruct slowly. There was a time when each 21 minute episode of the office would make me ROTFL at least 20 different times, but this time around I don't think I have laughed even once to any of the gags on the show even though 2/3rd s of the show has come to an end. However, 'The Farm' came as a welcome surprise; the reason is probably because the episode was written and directed by Paul Lieberstein who has written some of the best episodes of the entire season including my favorite 'Stress relief' from season 5.The Farm brought back a lot of memories of the show's glorious past, Dwight's extended family is a hoot no wonder they planned an entire series based on that premise which unfortunately got cancelled. The scene that made me laugh the most was one were Dwight shoots his dead aunt with a shot gun thrice to make sure that she wasn't alive. There are a few scenes in this episode that were added later to make it look like a part of the rest of the season instead of a pilot to anew show.I hope NBC releases the original pilot episode sometime soon.

The camera angles for starters was different and didn't give the feel that there was actually a camera crew there filming a documentary. The interviews had a cleaner look to them also. and then the final scene with Dwight and his siblings looking at the farm was odd ... then music started playing in the background. The Office has never done that before. Sure they've had the odd musical number in the background of a scene but that's only because there's been another scene playing parallel where some of the characters are actually singing/ making the music themselves. With out reading any other information about this episode, my initial thought after it finishing was that it felt like a pilot to a new series.

Something the office appeared to do well was character work, I actually disagree if you compare this to parks and rec even a non entity like Gary you know his daughters friends family etc and same with a large percentage.This show when it tried to force a huge rift in with jim and Pam there were no family friends or anything which could've atleast made this believable, even a phone call to portray emotions would've helped, it felt so forced solely for this kinda ending which did feel good.However both characters lost a lot of what made them special when Michael left, their communication, almost synchronicity died, it's hard to empathise with Pam as technically she's in a job she's bad at, is a failed artist, the mural wasn't even really sorted and didn't have many friends or close family except her mum, I'm sure she did but the only close moments with Pam were really Dwight and the camera guy, I can't understand why she wouldn't move. Jim bought a house and wanted a successful career and should've explained it way better and upfront as Pam was portrayed as fair and logical. However her salary plus a desire of being an artist would mean she'd need a lot of money something Jim was busting to get again made her just seem awkward and kinda selfish. I'm sure the ending may change this but I feel this series killed my love of Pam a fair bitTo the point I'm more invested in Dwight and Angela, let's be real Dwight is the MVP, he's the comedy clue, best character arc and the sweet moments with Pam and Jim are too cute.No coincidence that the sister writer seemed to force Erin down your throats, she's an OTT overbearing moron who's assault on Clarke was so badly acted it summed her up, emotionally childish and just a terrible damn character, had potential but she just is so cartoonish she's unbearableAndy should've died at see.Kevin should've had an arc to be semi normal by the end, I soon realised that most characters aren't actually that flushed out or great by the end, the only decent ones are fast loosing charm.I mean Mose

What made it even better was Jim pulling for him to get the job by saying, ""If there is someone out there who loves paper and this job more than Dwight, I do not want to meet that person!"" David Wallace smiles and nods.Let's be clear: as much as Jim and Dwight antagonize each other, they clearly like and even respect each other. That is what makes their relationship special. Jim saved Dwight from being fired by Robert California. Dwight makes Jim his ""#2"" man and tells annoying Clark to ""Get out of Jim's chair!"" That was awesome!Jim represents to Dwight a person who doesn't take life too seriously; to relax and not let things get to you so much.Dwight represents to Jim a person who is passionate about his work.

His Karate ceremony was funny tho. But the fact that Dwight wanted Jim to be the manager and how happy he'll be to see him like that, gave the biggest smile on my face I've ever had and same for Jim who wanted the same for Dwight. The first he did after being the manager was that he told the nerd guy to get up from Jim's seat and returned Jim the place he belongs. And Jim's decisions to leave everything aside and be in Scranton for Pam and his kids was so beautiful.
But let me just say it, the most beautiful thing about this episode was Andy's farewell song. I mean that song and his voice literally broke my soul. It was a super emotional moment for everyone whether be Ed Helms' fan or co workers or any office viewer.

And of course, Dwight finally gets his black belt in karate. Oh, and becomes the manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton!There was one fascinating part of the episode, where the characters give their opinions on Andy and his dream of being ""famous"" and becoming an entertainer. I don't know if the writers just thought if those opinions would be funny or if they finally realized that they should have ditched Andy a long time ago - but seeing some sense come back was very welcome. When the show was still focused on annoying things Michael Scott did, the characters didn't pamper and coddle him with compliments - no, instead they kept him somewhat grounded and brought him back to reality. Moving on, the interaction between Jim, Pam and Dwight was one of the high points of this episode. First, it reminds us that Dwight always had a soft spot for Pam (like in one of the previous seasons, when Pam and co. went to Dwight's farm in order to convince him to stop his doomsday e-mail); second it shows us that even though Jim used to prank Dwight, they still had some sort of a weird friendly relationship. Especially when Dwight gives Jim his old desk back, and when Jim refuses ""assisstant regional manager"", but accepts ""assisstant TO the regional manager"".Also, as the episode progresses we find out more about Angela's emotional state. She's broken and while she admits that she still loves Dwight, her pride is preventing her from going to him and appearing as a gold-digger. Quite sad, but things appear to be going in a better direction when Oscar (her ex-husbands former lover!) suggests living together until she can get back on her feet.All in all, it wasn't a bad episode.

It's hard to appreciate the ""highs"" without the ""lows."" And this episode was a tremendous ""high"" to be sure!Once again, Jim comes through, and in more ways than one. Pam is now feeling guilty as she starts to think that she's the obstacle preventing Jim from fulfilling his dream. What she doesn't realize is that SHE and their family is his dream! The way that Jim goes about proving this to her is beyond touching. I don't know of anyone who wouldn't be bowled over by such a profound, romantic gesture as this one, which ties all the way back to the Christmas episode involving the teapot. Magical and fantastic way of the writer to put that in there.I have a hard time deciding which is more profoundly epic and sublime: Jim's gesture to Pam, or Jim telling Dwight what is truly important in life. That bit of dialogue is something that every, single person should either read or listen to if you are having trouble trying to answer that question about what is important to you in life.

1329,9,23,,bob the moo,14 September 2013,"The previous season of this show indicated to me that really it should have drawn it closed when its star left; OK it was still a decent season but the quality shift was obvious and it was clear that ideas and characters were being recycled. This is even more evident at the start of this season when new characters are rolled in, plots are mostly ridiculous and generally laughs are sparse. After about 5 or 6 episodes I wondered if I should bother carrying on but decided I wanted to at least watch it to the end having watched it from the start.There is stuff to love about this season. It is occasionally funny and although it so clearly below previous standards, the old tropes are still here and still work. It also of course has a nice sense of closure to it and, although I didn't think it all worked, it was nice to walk the characters to the door. The plots really do let it down though. I have always enjoyed the goofy subplots and asides but here they seem to have taken over and too much has no flow and no context within the lives of the characters. Worse most of it isn't particularly funny or engaging. Breaking the fourth wall might have been a good idea but it is only ever half done and seems artificial. Bringing he crew into the show and bringing the film into reality also meant that I was forced to question the logic of the ever-present camera – plus the idea that someone would make a reality show for 9 years before screening it. I understand it is a comedy but since this device brought nothing to the table, the questions were more pronounced.It is really for fans who are still watching after 9 seasons, so I can understand if it doesn't try too hard and does rather tend towards sentiment, but it is a shame that such a strong show had to crawl out like this – hemorrhaging regulars and generally being noticeably below its own bar so consistently. The cast are mixed. The regulars mostly live their characters and deliver well even when the material is weaker than they deserve but various famous cameos add nothing but the scene of desperation. Tate continues not to work for me – and she stands out for not fitting into the show, particularly in such a sentimental ""farewell"" type season.It isn't without merit as a season but mostly it serves to remind the viewer why the show is being ended – after watching this ninth season, very few people would have been protesting bringing it to a close.",18/62,previous season show indicate really draw closed star leave still decent season quality shift obvious clear idea character recycle even evident start season new character roll plot mostly ridiculous generally laugh sparse episode wonder bother carry decide want least watch end watch start stuff love season occasionally funny although clearly previous standard old trope still still work also course nice sense closure although think work nice walk character door plot really let though always enjoy goofy subplot aside seem take much flow context within life character bad particularly funny engaging break fourth wall may good idea ever half seem artificial bring crew show bring film reality also mean force question logic ever present camera plus idea someone would make reality show year screen understand comedy since device bring nothing table question pronounced really fan still watch season understand try hard rather tend towards sentiment shame strong show crawl like hemorrhage regular generally noticeably bar consistently cast mixed regular mostly live character deliver well even material weak deserve various famous cameo add nothing scene desperation tate continue work stand fit show particularly sentimental farewell type season without merit season mostly serve remind viewer show end watch ninth season people would protest bring close,"['previous', 'season', 'show', 'indicate', 'really', 'draw', 'closed', 'star', 'leave', 'still', 'decent', 'season', 'quality', 'shift', 'obvious', 'clear', 'idea', 'character', 'recycle', 'even', 'evident', 'start', 'season', 'new', 'character', 'roll', 'plot', 'mostly', 'ridiculous', 'generally', 'laugh', 'sparse', 'episode', 'wonder', 'bother', 'carry', 'decide', 'want', 'least', 'watch', 'end', 'watch', 'start', 'stuff', 'love', 'season', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'although', 'clearly', 'previous', 'standard', 'old', 'trope', 'still', 'still', 'work', 'also', 'course', 'nice', 'sense', 'closure', 'although', 'think', 'work', 'nice', 'walk', 'character', 'door', 'plot', 'really', 'let', 'though', 'always', 'enjoy', 'goofy', 'subplot', 'aside', 'seem', 'take', 'much', 'flow', 'context', 'within', 'life', 'character', 'bad', 'particularly', 'funny', 'engaging', 'break', 'fourth', 'wall', 'may', 'good', 'idea', 'ever', 'half', 'seem', 'artificial', 'bring', 'crew', 'show', 'bring', 'film', 'reality', 'also', 'mean', 'force', 'question', 'logic', 'ever', 'present', 'camera', 'plus', 'idea', 'someone', 'would', 'make', 'reality', 'show', 'year', 'screen', 'understand', 'comedy', 'since', 'device', 'bring', 'nothing', 'table', 'question', 'pronounced', 'really', 'fan', 'still', 'watch', 'season', 'understand', 'try', 'hard', 'rather', 'tend', 'towards', 'sentiment', 'shame', 'strong', 'show', 'crawl', 'like', 'hemorrhage', 'regular', 'generally', 'noticeably', 'bar', 'consistently', 'cast', 'mixed', 'regular', 'mostly', 'live', 'character', 'deliver', 'well', 'even', 'material', 'weak', 'deserve', 'various', 'famous', 'cameo', 'add', 'nothing', 'scene', 'desperation', 'tate', 'continue', 'work', 'stand', 'fit', 'show', 'particularly', 'sentimental', 'farewell', 'type', 'season', 'without', 'merit', 'season', 'mostly', 'serve', 'remind', 'viewer', 'show', 'end', 'watch', 'ninth', 'season', 'people', 'would', 'protest', 'bring', 'close']"

1331,9,23,6.0,zkonedog,5 July 2019,"Despite being a loyal fan of ""The Office"" for many years, the show hit such a rock bottom after the horrific eighth season that I actually considered dropping out entirely. Luckily, the show producers (and NBC) must have realized the same thing, as the decision to label this the ""Final Season"" did wonders in terms of all-around quality.There are three main reasons why this final season made ""The Office"" watchable again (minor spoilers)...1. The departure of Andy Bernard for the first portion of the season. The show had pretty much completely wrecked that character during that eighth season, so (despite all that the ""Nard Dog"" had brought to the show in previous seasons) his absence was needed just to get away from his terrible character for awhile.2. With Andy out of the picture, the focus shifted again to where it should have been all along...the incredible ensemble cast. Whereas the eighth season focused WAAAAYYY too much on guest stars and gimmicks, this season gets back to the tried-and-true formula of just letting the characters play out and watching the hijinx ensue.3. In the past, as evidenced by the Wedding & Baby episodes for instance, whenever the writers of this show have desperately needed a really good string of episodes, they have always come through. This was again true down the ""stretch run"" of this season, as the final slew of episodes are truly magical once again with the writers being able to ""pull out all the stops"". The finale could easily be considered one of the best episodes of the entire show for its equal parts drama & comedy (what the show always needed to succeed in the first place).Now, don't get me wrong...this is not the best season of ""The Office"" by any stretch of the imagination. Without Michael Scott, this show was just never going to be the same again. However, it was nice that the finale season was able to pull itself up just enough to make me look forward to watching it each week instead of dreading it.Thus, the Ninth (and final) Season of ""The Office"" was able to do just enough to justify the ""goes out on a good note"" tag. Seeing as how this was on the heels of bottoming out the previous year, it is a testament to all the show creators/writers/actors who truly cared enough to make the ending of this great show special.",9/52,despite loyal fan office many year show hit rock bottom horrific eighth season actually consider drop entirely luckily show producer nbc must realize thing decision label final season wonder term around quality three main reason final season make office watchable minor spoilers) departure andy bernard first portion season show pretty much completely wreck character eighth season despite nard_dog bring show previous season absence need get away terrible character awhile.0 andy picture focus shift along incredible ensemble cast whereas eighth season focus waaaayyy much guest star gimmick season get back try true formula let character play watch hijinx ensue.0 past evidence wedding baby episode instance whenever writer show desperately need really good string episode always come true stretch run season final slew episode truly magical writer able pull stop finale could easily consider one good_episode entire show equal part drama comedy show always need succeed first place).now get wrong good season office stretch imagination without michael_scott show never however nice finale season able pull enough make look_forward watch week instead dread thus ninth final season office able enough justify good note tag see heel bottom previous year testament show creator writer actor truly care enough make ending great show special,"['despite', 'loyal', 'fan', 'office', 'many', 'year', 'show', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'horrific', 'eighth', 'season', 'actually', 'consider', 'drop', 'entirely', 'luckily', 'show', 'producer', 'nbc', 'must', 'realize', 'thing', 'decision', 'label', 'final', 'season', 'wonder', 'term', 'around', 'quality', 'three', 'main', 'reason', 'final', 'season', 'make', 'office', 'watchable', 'minor', 'spoilers', ')', 'departure', 'andy', 'bernard', 'first', 'portion', 'season', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'completely', 'wreck', 'character', 'eighth', 'season', 'despite', 'nard_dog', 'bring', 'show', 'previous', 'season', 'absence', 'need', 'get', 'away', 'terrible', 'character', 'awhile.0', 'andy', 'picture', 'focus', 'shift', 'along', 'incredible', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'whereas', 'eighth', 'season', 'focus', 'waaaayyy', 'much', 'guest', 'star', 'gimmick', 'season', 'get', 'back', 'try', 'true', 'formula', 'let', 'character', 'play', 'watch', 'hijinx', 'ensue.0', 'past', 'evidence', 'wedding', 'baby', 'episode', 'instance', 'whenever', 'writer', 'show', 'desperately', 'need', 'really', 'good', 'string', 'episode', 'always', 'come', 'true', 'stretch', 'run', 'season', 'final', 'slew', 'episode', 'truly', 'magical', 'writer', 'able', 'pull', 'stop', 'finale', 'could', 'easily', 'consider', 'one', 'good_episode', 'entire', 'show', 'equal', 'part', 'drama', 'comedy', 'show', 'always', 'need', 'succeed', 'first', 'place).now', 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'season', 'office', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'without', 'michael_scott', 'show', 'never', 'however', 'nice', 'finale', 'season', 'able', 'pull', 'enough', 'make', 'look_forward', 'watch', 'week', 'instead', 'dread', 'thus', 'ninth', 'final', 'season', 'office', 'able', 'enough', 'justify', 'good', 'note', 'tag', 'see', 'heel', 'bottom', 'previous', 'year', 'testament', 'show', 'creator', 'writer', 'actor', 'truly', 'care', 'enough', 'make', 'ending', 'great', 'show', 'special']"

I have grown up with these characters as part of my life and throughout my life they have served as friends when I had no other ones. The last few years these characters have been there for me and seeing them grow has helped me grow. A show that means so much to me had to finish perfectly or it all would be ruined. Tonight I sat down already teary eyed knowing that they would be gone from my life in an hour. The episode delivered great laughs, but it delivered a lot more. The episode delivered very intimate moments that were much needed. Plot lines that begun throughout the show came to a good conclusion and old stars returned with perfect timing. It was a sweet, beautiful, amazing, perfect love letter from the amazing cast to all of it's fans. I must admit that I was in tears seeing how much the characters had grown since we first visited this little town of Scranton Pennsylvania. The story line of the friendship between Dwight and Jim is particularly heart- warming. Every character ended up just where they should have and the final shot was perfection. ""Sometimes goodbyes are a *****"" but this perfect love letter softened the blow. The show will be missed, but it did end perfectly.",276/285,say farewell show mean much many people?it kind event judge extent certain point love letter fan craig daniels write draw emotionally end love guess deserve give show good tribute let start teenager life bully never many friend last year especially tough struggle intense thing lead serious action say least grow character part life throughout life serve friend one last year character see grow help grow show mean much finish perfectly would ruin tonight sit already teary eyed know would life hour episode deliver great laugh deliver lot episode deliver intimate moment much need plot line begin throughout show come good conclusion old star return perfect timing sweet beautiful amazing perfect love letter amazing cast fan must admit tear see much character grow since first visit little town scranton pennsylvania story line friendship dwight jim particularly heart- warming every character end final shot perfection sometimes goodbye perfect love letter soften blow show miss end perfectly,"['say', 'farewell', 'show', 'mean', 'much', 'many', 'people?it', 'kind', 'event', 'judge', 'extent', 'certain', 'point', 'love', 'letter', 'fan', 'craig', 'daniels', 'write', 'draw', 'emotionally', 'end', 'love', 'guess', 'deserve', 'give', 'show', 'good', 'tribute', 'let', 'start', 'teenager', 'life', 'bully', 'never', 'many', 'friend', 'last', 'year', 'especially', 'tough', 'struggle', 'intense', 'thing', 'lead', 'serious', 'action', 'say', 'least', 'grow', 'character', 'part', 'life', 'throughout', 'life', 'serve', 'friend', 'one', 'last', 'year', 'character', 'see', 'grow', 'help', 'grow', 'show', 'mean', 'much', 'finish', 'perfectly', 'would', 'ruin', 'tonight', 'sit', 'already', 'teary', 'eyed', 'know', 'would', 'life', 'hour', 'episode', 'deliver', 'great', 'laugh', 'deliver', 'lot', 'episode', 'deliver', 'intimate', 'moment', 'much', 'need', 'plot', 'line', 'begin', 'throughout', 'show', 'come', 'good', 'conclusion', 'old', 'star', 'return', 'perfect', 'timing', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'amazing', 'perfect', 'love', 'letter', 'amazing', 'cast', 'fan', 'must', 'admit', 'tear', 'see', 'much', 'character', 'grow', 'since', 'first', 'visit', 'little', 'town', 'scranton', 'pennsylvania', 'story', 'line', 'friendship', 'dwight', 'jim', 'particularly', 'heart-', 'warming', 'every', 'character', 'end', 'final', 'shot', 'perfection', 'sometimes', 'goodbye', 'perfect', 'love', 'letter', 'soften', 'blow', 'show', 'miss', 'end', 'perfectly']"

1345,9,23,10.0,samtko-04675,10 October 2019,"The Office has always stood out as one of the best comedy shows for it's real meshing of humor and chemistry, however Season 8 and the first half of Season 9 lost the heart that the show was also known for, but the writers knew they had to go out on a high note and decided to push everything towards an amazing conclusion during the second half of Season 9.
Well this is that conclusion and it is the best pay off anyone could ask for, I spent half of this finale smiling & laughing, and the other half fighting off the urge to cry.The last 10 minutes include interviews from the characters regarding how the documentary crew has recorded their last 10 years, it's surprisingly emotional, each of them regarding how they've grown up, both in age and as people. Erin's is probably the funniest and most emotional as she asks how they managed to capture exactly what it was like, before adding in humor of how a camera works, it truly hits home with how the nature of the show is.Jim and Pam's ending is something that is somewhat expected but nevertheless very sweet and very true to who they are.
Dwight's ending is surprisingly heartfelt after all the time spent throughout most of the series either being teased or disliked by most of the office, his conclusion ended up being one of friendship with his co-workers and finally getting the woman he truly loves.
Finally I couldn't leave this review without mentioning Steve Carell's cameo return as Micheal Scott, he doesn't say very much but his appearance means a lot.All I can say is that this episode knocks it out of the park, and is the reason The Office didn't end up getting forgotten",8/8,office always stand one good comedy show real meshing humor chemistry however season first half season lose heart show also know writer know high note decide push everything towards amazing conclusion second half season well conclusion good pay anyone could ask spend half finale smile laughing half fighting urge cry last minute include interview character regard documentary crew record last year surprisingly emotional regard grow age people erin probably funniest emotional ask manage capture exactly like add humor camera work truly hit home nature show jim_pam ending something somewhat expect nevertheless sweet true dwight ending surprisingly heartfelt time spend throughout series either tease dislike office conclusion end one friendship worker finally get woman truly love finally could leave review without mention steve_carell cameo return micheal scott say much appearance mean lot say episode knock park reason office end get forget,"['office', 'always', 'stand', 'one', 'good', 'comedy', 'show', 'real', 'meshing', 'humor', 'chemistry', 'however', 'season', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'lose', 'heart', 'show', 'also', 'know', 'writer', 'know', 'high', 'note', 'decide', 'push', 'everything', 'towards', 'amazing', 'conclusion', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'well', 'conclusion', 'good', 'pay', 'anyone', 'could', 'ask', 'spend', 'half', 'finale', 'smile', 'laughing', 'half', 'fighting', 'urge', 'cry', 'last', 'minute', 'include', 'interview', 'character', 'regard', 'documentary', 'crew', 'record', 'last', 'year', 'surprisingly', 'emotional', 'regard', 'grow', 'age', 'people', 'erin', 'probably', 'funniest', 'emotional', 'ask', 'manage', 'capture', 'exactly', 'like', 'add', 'humor', 'camera', 'work', 'truly', 'hit', 'home', 'nature', 'show', 'jim_pam', 'ending', 'something', 'somewhat', 'expect', 'nevertheless', 'sweet', 'true', 'dwight', 'ending', 'surprisingly', 'heartfelt', 'time', 'spend', 'throughout', 'series', 'either', 'tease', 'dislike', 'office', 'conclusion', 'end', 'one', 'friendship', 'worker', 'finally', 'get', 'woman', 'truly', 'love', 'finally', 'could', 'leave', 'review', 'without', 'mention', 'steve_carell', 'cameo', 'return', 'micheal', 'scott', 'say', 'much', 'appearance', 'mean', 'lot', 'say', 'episode', 'knock', 'park', 'reason', 'office', 'end', 'get', 'forget']"

1348,9,23,5.0,HunterGee,11 December 2021,"Okay so it sucks when a show loses its main and even secondary characters in its last few seasons, especially sitcoms.This finale wasn't bad it just didn't feel right just like it's last two seasons.Sure they were funny at times, but that's not what an audience returns for. Partly yes, but what we really come back for is the characters.The absence of Steve Carell (Michael Scott) left the series in a feeling of lack. That familiarity we had for the seven seasons was suddenly gone.It felt as it was a complete different show, even know most of the other characters remained.As much as we love the rest of the cast it's just not the same.They tried to replace Michael Scott over and over with various characters but nothing could fit. It's impossible to do that with a beloved character. Just as when Charlie Harper was replaced by Walden Schmidt in Two and a Half Men.My point is that this finale wasn't bad In my opinion because of the writing. It was bad because it was an ending to a different show than the one we started watching.Michael Scott did return for a whole 2 lines and 3 short scenes, though I felt as I was watching Steve Carell on screen and not the world's best boss.We didn't even get to see him in the office with the rest of the gang at the end of the show.This final could never have been what it would have been if Carell hadn't left the show.I'd like to add that I don't blame the actor for his choice to leave.Whenever I rewatch this show in the future I don't see myself watching its last two seasons.If I ever have my own sitcom or any other show and the lead actor chooses to leave, I'll end the show in that season. I'm not sure if that was an option with this show, but it's better to have a solid complete series than to sell out for a couple more seasons because a shows a hit.",4/8,okay suck show lose main even secondary character last season especially sitcom finale bad feel right like last two season sure funny time audience return partly yes really come back character absence steve_carell michael_scott leave series feeling lack familiarity seven season suddenly feel complete different show even know character remain much love rest cast try replace michael_scott various character nothing could fit impossible beloved character charlie harper replace walden schmidt two half men point finale bad opinion writing bad ending different show one start watch michael_scott return whole line short scene though feel watch steve_carell screen world good boss even get see office rest gang end show final could never would carell leave show i'd like add blame actor choice leave whenever rewatch show future see watch last two season ever sitcom show lead actor choose leave end show season sure option show well solid complete series sell couple season show hit,"['okay', 'suck', 'show', 'lose', 'main', 'even', 'secondary', 'character', 'last', 'season', 'especially', 'sitcom', 'finale', 'bad', 'feel', 'right', 'like', 'last', 'two', 'season', 'sure', 'funny', 'time', 'audience', 'return', 'partly', 'yes', 'really', 'come', 'back', 'character', 'absence', 'steve_carell', 'michael_scott', 'leave', 'series', 'feeling', 'lack', 'familiarity', 'seven', 'season', 'suddenly', 'feel', 'complete', 'different', 'show', 'even', 'know', 'character', 'remain', 'much', 'love', 'rest', 'cast', 'try', 'replace', 'michael_scott', 'various', 'character', 'nothing', 'could', 'fit', 'impossible', 'beloved', 'character', 'charlie', 'harper', 'replace', 'walden', 'schmidt', 'two', 'half', 'men', 'point', 'finale', 'bad', 'opinion', 'writing', 'bad', 'ending', 'different', 'show', 'one', 'start', 'watch', 'michael_scott', 'return', 'whole', 'line', 'short', 'scene', 'though', 'feel', 'watch', 'steve_carell', 'screen', 'world', 'good', 'boss', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'office', 'rest', 'gang', 'end', 'show', 'final', 'could', 'never', 'would', 'carell', 'leave', 'show', 'i', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'blame', 'actor', 'choice', 'leave', 'whenever', 'rewatch', 'show', 'future', 'see', 'watch', 'last', 'two', 'season', 'ever', 'sitcom', 'show', 'lead', 'actor', 'choose', 'leave', 'end', 'show', 'season', 'sure', 'option', 'show', 'well', 'solid', 'complete', 'series', 'sell', 'couple', 'season', 'show', 'hit']"

A few months ago, I was looking at series on IMDb which had good ratings
I decided which ones I wanted to watch and made a list
One day I was looking at my little list for something to watch and I came across the Office
I thought it would be a fun, and delightful experience with nothing really deep in it
It was a lot of fun
Fast forward a few seasons, and when Michael left the show I honestly got so emotional
I didn't write a review but I think Michael was my favourite and his story and his character was well finished. I was sad to let him go
2 seasons later, we have this episode ""The Finale""
I must say... Most of the endings to some series were disappointing
But this episode got it right
They realized that Michael's story is already finished, he HAD TO make an appearance and he did, but he did not steal the time from others, we got to know that he's doing okay and he has children, but that's itEveryone's dreams came true in the end, reallyKevin had his own pub, and I think he was happy about itErin got to know her real parentsIn the end, Phyllis was happy because he reunited with all of her friends, he got a little statue of herself from Stanley, and she got married on the showAndy got a job at CornellNellie finally got a childHopefully, Ryan and Kelly are together til the rest of their lives, they both had really bad qualities, so they are perfect for each otherStanley has a quiet and peaceful life, just how he wantedDarryl is with Val, he quit Dunder Mifflin to work in AthleapOscar is running for state senator, and is the godfather of PhilipAngela is happily married to DwightDwight has a wife as Angela, has a child, Philip, and is finally the Manager of the Scranton branchJim and Pam are together, married, have children, and are going to fulfill each other's dreams for the rest of their lifeCreed was basically a joke character, and he got what he deserved, whatever it was what he's doneI talked about Michael before, andWell, as for the newer guys, they are still going to wait for their dreams to be coming trueAnd of course the replacement people show that life will continue in Dunder Mifflin, though the documentary is overAnd just... Wow
They all said some funny and some very true things... All I can say is, that
When I first saw the show I thought that it would be just a fun ride
But now that I watched it, I can say that it was so much more
It was... People
Mostly good, but rather average people
And I'm gonna miss them
I will never forget the Office, and I will never forget that the Office could do so much for me
It made me wiser and happier, and I must thank the creators for that
They did an amazing job
